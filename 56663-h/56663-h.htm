<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>In the following account of the life and work of that
&ldquo;hero and type of the intellectual energy of the
eighteenth century&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;honest heretic&rdquo;&mdash;Joseph
Priestley, I have, to a considerable extent, made the
subject of it tell his own story. After Priestley&rsquo;s death
there was found among his papers a short autobiography,
dealing with the main events of his life up
to the time of his settlement in America. This was
subsequently published, with additions and explanatory
notes, by his eldest son. Of this biography I have
made full use, considering it, of course, as the best
authority on the matters to which it refers.</p>
<p>For the account of the Warrington Academy, with
which institution Priestley was connected for some years,
and which connection profoundly affected his career, I
am mainly indebted to Mr Henry A. Bright&rsquo;s paper in
the <i>Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and
Cheshire</i>, 1858-59.</p>
<p>The Yates papers in the possession of the Royal
Society have also afforded me much assistance, and have
been freely drawn upon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>I am also indebted to the late Mr Henry Carrington
Bolton&rsquo;s collection for certain letters and for information
concerning the Lunar Society of Birmingham.</p>
<p>For the graphic account of the Birmingham Riots of
1791, when Priestley&rsquo;s house was wrecked, and his
library and laboratory destroyed, as described by an
eye-witness, Miss Martha Russell, I have to express
my obligations to her relative, Dr W. J. Russell, who
first made me acquainted with her narrative. I am also
indebted to Dr Russell for a copy of the print from
which has been prepared the illustration showing the
destruction of Priestley&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>I desire also to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr
Aikin for permission to publish certain of Priestley&rsquo;s
letters to his distinguished connection, Mrs Barbauld.</p>
<p>I am further under obligations to Lady Priestley,
Lady Roscoe and Mr Sydney Lupton for much useful
assistance.</p>
<p>The portrait of Priestley, which forms the frontispiece,
has been reproduced in photogravure from the
painting by Artaud, now in Dr Williams&rsquo; Theological
Library in Gordon Square. I have to thank the
Trustees of the Library for their kindness in allowing
the copy to be made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Birth&mdash;Parentage&mdash;Home Life&mdash;Early Education</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; says Mr Frederic Harrison, &ldquo;we choose one man
as a type of the intellectual energy of the eighteenth
century we could hardly find a better than Joseph
Priestley, though his was not the greatest mind of
the century. His versatility, eagerness, activity and
humanity; the immense range of his curiosity in all
things, physical, moral or social; his place in science, in
theology, in philosophy and in politics; his peculiar relation
to the Revolution, and the pathetic story of his
unmerited sufferings, may make him the hero of the
eighteenth century.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In these few lines Mr Harrison has indicated, in terms
sufficiently precise, the leading features in the character
and life-history of one of the most remarkable men of the
eighteenth century. To what extent he may be regarded
as a hero and as a type of the intellectual energy of that
century it is the purpose of the following pages to make
clear.</p>
<p>Joseph Priestley was born at Fieldhead, in the parish
of Birstall, near Leeds, on March 13 (Old Style), 1733.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
He was named after his paternal grandfather, &ldquo;an eminent
tradesman, as much famed for his heavenly conduct as
his grandson (Joseph) has since been for natural abilities.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Priestleys,&rdquo; writes Madame Belloc, the great-granddaughter
of the subject of this memoir, in her charming essay,
&ldquo;Joseph Priestley in Domestic Life&rdquo; (<i>Contemporary Review</i>,
October 1894), &ldquo;were of an old Presbyterian stock; one branch
of the family acquired wealth and lived at Whiteways, but his
(Joseph&rsquo;s) own immediate ancestors were farmers and clothiers,
people of substance in the yeoman class. We can trace them
accurately as far as the middle of the seventeenth century, when
one Ph&oelig;be Priestley, after wrestling with fever in her household,
was herself stricken, and &lsquo;lay like a lamb before the Lord&rsquo; on
her deathbed. Her husband wrote a long and touching account
of all she said and did, that her children might know what manner
of mother they had lost. These people were presumably of the
same stock as the Priestleys of Soylands, who ran back into the
Middle Ages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children of the Priestley families were all named after
scriptural characters. They were Josephs, Timothys and Sarahs
from one generation to another. The Bible was stamped into
them, and from it they drew all the inspiration of their lives.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph Priestley the elder was born in 1660, and
died on August 2, 1745. He married Sarah Healey
and had by her eight children, five sons and three
daughters, of whom Jonas, the father of Joseph Priestley
the younger, born about 1700, was the seventh child and
fourth son. Jonas Priestley married Mary, a daughter
of Joseph Swift, a farmer and maltster of Shafton, near
Wakefield, and had by her six children, four sons and two
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
daughters, of whom Joseph was the eldest and Timothy
the second; Martha, the elder girl, who died in 1812,
married John Crouch, and was left a widow in poor circumstances
in 1786. Another member of the Priestley
family who requires mention for the purpose of this
narrative is Sarah, the sister of Jonas and second daughter
of Joseph Priestley the elder. She was born in 1692
and married John Keighley&mdash;&ldquo;a man who had distinguished
himself for his zeal for religion and for his
public spirit.&rdquo; She was left a widow in 1745. Three
years before this she took her nephew Joseph, the
subject of this memoir, to live with her, and &ldquo;was fond
of him in the extreme.&rdquo; She died in 1764. Her
brother John, Joseph Priestley the younger&rsquo;s uncle, died
on February 28, 1786, aged ninety-two. &ldquo;He was a
remarkable man and of a singularly happy constitution,
both of body and mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This happy constitution of body and mind seems
indeed to have been a characteristic of many members
of the family, the several branches of which were
remarkably healthy and long-lived.</p>
<p>Priestley says of his father Jonas that he had uniformly
better spirits than any man he ever knew, and
by this means was as happy towards the close of life,
when reduced to poverty and dependent upon others, as
in his best days. These facts are not without interest
as serving to account for much that we shall have
occasion to note in the character and temperament of
the subject of this biography.</p>
<p>Fieldhead, the house in which he first saw the light,
had been occupied by the family for several generations.
It was a small two-storey building, built of stone and
slated with flag, similar in character to many of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
houses still standing in the district, the long, low
windows in the upper storeys betokening that they were
formerly occupied by weavers. It was last lived in by
Martha Priestley (Mrs Crouch), but on the death of her
husband in 1786 was abandoned by the family, and,
falling into decay, was pulled down about fifty years
ago.</p>
<p>The Priestleys were a simple, sober, honest, God-fearing
folk, staunch Calvinists, and deeply religious.
Jonas Priestley was a manufacturer of &ldquo;home-spun&rdquo;&mdash;a
weaver and cloth dresser&mdash;two trades now distinct but
then practised in common&mdash;who took his week&rsquo;s work
on ass-back, on roads little better than bridle-paths, to
the Sunday market in Leeds. He was of a class
characteristic of the district.</p>
<p>These hand-loom weavers, who lived in the hill
country lying to the west of Leeds, were generally men
of small capitals; they often annexed a small farm to
their business, or possessed a field or two on which to
support a horse and cow, and were for the most part
blessed with the comforts without the superfluities of
life. During five or six days of the week they dwelt
in their own little village, among trees and fields, taking
no thought of the outside world and contenting themselves
with the homely gossip of their farmstead or
hamlet. On market day they came into the town in
shoals, clad in their quaint corduroy breeches, broad-brimmed
hats, and brass-buttoned coats of antique cut,
bringing their produce on pack-horses, to await the
visits of the merchants&mdash;the commercial aristocracy of
Leeds, then a town of some 16,000 or 17,000 inhabitants&mdash;who
were the agents through which the outer
world received its supply of Yorkshire woollen
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
goods. They were a shrewd, careful race, somewhat
stolid and slow of speech and not given to great mental
briskness or activity, keenly appreciative of the blessings
of liberty and usually in sympathy with the political
party to whom the cause of liberty was for the moment
entrusted; sober, godly souls for the most part; regular
in their attendance at public worship, and upon the
whole preferring the plebeian zeal of the Chapel to the
aristocratic repose of the Church.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="caption">BIRTHPLACE OF PRIESTLEY.</p>
</div>
<p>And what a world it was in which they thus serenely
dwelt apart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; writes Madame Belloc, &ldquo;the time of Louis the
Fifteenth in France and of George the Second in England, and
the nephews and nieces of Charlotte Princess Palatine were still
living, and her letters, whose name is legion, yet lay stored in
the cabinets of her correspondents, full of inexpressible details
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
discussed in most expressive language. It was the time when
Jeanie Deans walked from Scotland to beg her sister&rsquo;s life of
Queen Caroline, and met Madge Wildfire in the way. It was
the time when the polite world was composed of &lsquo;men, women
and Herveys&rsquo;; when Squire Pendarves was found dead in his
bed in Greek Street, Soho, leaving his young widow to be
courted by John Wesley and wedded by Dr Delany; when
statesmen bribed, and young blades drank, and Sir Harbottle
carried off Harriet Byron, whose shrieks brought Sir Charles
Grandison to the rescue, sword in hand. It was the period
when the Jacobite Rebellion flamed up and expired; when the
Young Pretender marched to Derby and the heads of the
decapitated lords were exposed on Temple Bar; tragedies,
agonies, highway robberies, Dick Turpin, Jack Sheppard,
smugglers, the press-gang; Frederick Prince of Wales quarrelling
in Leicester Square; Queen Caroline on her death-bed
telling her weeping little George, &lsquo;que l&rsquo;un n&rsquo;emp&ecirc;che pas
l&rsquo;autre&rsquo;; Horace Walpole making the grand tour; Dean Swift
dying in agonised misery. Merciful Heavens! What an England,
of which we possess the daily diary! We can see Hogarth
at his easel, and Sir Joshua taking his first stiff portraits, and
Garrick going on pilgrimage to Stratford, and the young king
courting Hannah Lightfoot and marrying his little bride from
Mecklenburg. Without too much verifying of dates it is
certain that all this was happening before Dr Priestley was
thirty years of age, and that of none of it is there the faintest
mention in the account he has drawn up of his own childhood,
youth and young manhood, though he was himself destined to
be one of the principal illustrations of the Georgian era. For
anything which appears to the contrary, he and his friends might
have dwelt in some far-distant planet whose inhabitants were
wholly given up to study and to prayer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley says of his father that he had a strong sense
of religion, praying with his family morning and evening,
and carefully teaching his children and servants the
Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism, which was all the system of
which he had any knowledge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the latter part of his life he became very fond of Mr
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Whitfield&rsquo;s writings and other works of a similar kind, having
been brought up in the principles of Calvinism, and adopting
them, but without ever giving much attention to matters of
speculation, and entertaining no bigoted aversion to those who
differed from him on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may well imagine that Jonas, with his &ldquo;strong
sense of religion,&rdquo; was one of that earnest band of
&ldquo;several hundreds of plain people&rdquo; who listened, spellbound,
to the eloquence of John Wesley on that
memorable day of May 1742, on which, on Birstall Hill,
began the great Yorkshire &ldquo;Revival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of his wife, &ldquo;a woman of exemplary piety,&rdquo; the
mother of the future philosopher, little has been recorded
beyond the fragmentary notice in her son&rsquo;s autobiography.
He says of her:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is but little that I can recollect of my mother. I
remember, however, that she was careful to teach me the
Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism, and to give me the best instructions
the little time that I was at home. Once in particular, when
I was playing with a pin, she asked me where I got it; and on
telling her that I found it at my uncle&rsquo;s, who lived very near to
my father, and where I had been playing with my cousins, she
made me carry it back again; no doubt to impress my mind,
as it could not fail to do, with a clear idea of the distinction of
property and of the importance of attending to it. She died
in the hard winter of 1739,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> not long  after being delivered of
my youngest brother; and having dreamed a little before her
death that she was in a delightful place, which she particularly
described and imagined to be heaven, the last words which
she spake, as my aunt informed me, were, &lsquo;Let me go to that
fine place.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During some considerable portion of his mother&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
short period of married life, Joseph Priestley, together
with his brother Timothy, was committed to the care
of his grandfather Swift, with whom he remained with
little interruption until his mother&rsquo;s death. From this
we may infer that the domestic circumstances of his
parents were far from easy, or that the accommodation
at Fieldhead was unequal to the support of the cloth-dresser&rsquo;s
rapidly-increasing family.</p>
<p>Timothy, who, after following his father&rsquo;s business as a
cloth-dresser for a time, became an Independent minister,
and died in London, has left us reminiscences of his
brother&rsquo;s boyhood. He seems to have been particularly
impressed with his ability to repeat the Assembly&rsquo;s
Catechism &ldquo;without missing a word,&rdquo; and by being
made to kneel down with him while he prayed. &ldquo;This
was not at bed-time, which he never neglected, but in
the course of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the death of his mother, the eldest boy, then barely
six years old, was taken home and sent to school in the
neighbourhood. Luckily for him, his Aunt Sarah, Mrs
Keighley, &ldquo;a truly pious and excellent woman, who knew
no other use of wealth, or of talents of any kind, than to
do good, and who never spared herself for this purpose,&rdquo;
being childless, offered, in 1742, to relieve her brother
Jonas of all care for his eldest son by taking entire
charge of him. &ldquo;From this time,&rdquo; says her nephew,
&ldquo;she was truly a parent to me, till her death in 1764.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Keighley was a man of considerable property,
and at his death, which occurred when Priestley was
about twelve years of age, the widow was left with the
greater part of his fortune for life, and much of it at
her disposal after her death.</p>
<p>By Mrs Keighley&rsquo;s direction he was sent, he tells us,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
to several schools in the neighbourhood, especially to a
large free school under the care of a clergyman, Mr
Hague, under whom, at the age of twelve or thirteen,
he first began to make progress in Latin and acquired
the elements of Greek. His brother Timothy records
that &ldquo;from eleven to about thirteen he had read most
of Mr Bunyan&rsquo;s works and other authors on religion,
besides the common Latin authors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How a well-ordered school was conducted in the
middle of the eighteenth century may be gleaned from
the following regulations in force in Mr Canton&rsquo;s well-known
academy in 1745:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. That the School hours are from 7 o&rsquo;clock in the morning
till 12, and from 2 to 5 in the afternoon: except the winter
half-year, when they begin at 8 in the morning.</p>
<p>2. That all the Scholars come decently, that is, with their
Hands and Faces wash&rsquo;d, their Hair or Perriwigs Comb&rsquo;d, and
their Shoes black&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>3. That they bow at Coming in and going out, and when
any Thing is given or rec&rsquo;d; and never wear their Hats in the
House or School.</p>
<p>4. That they loiter not, but go immediately to their own
seats and move not thence, without Leave, till School is done.</p>
<p>5. That if any Person come into the School whom they
know, they are to get up, make a bow, and sit down in their
places again.</p>
<p>6. That if the Master be discoursing with, or reading to
any Person, they shall not stare Confidently on them or
hearken to their Talk, unless required to be present.</p>
<p>7. That they shall not interrupt the Master while a Stranger
is talking with him, with any Question, request, or complaint
whatsoever, but stay till he is at Leisure.</p>
<p>8. That they shall not presume to talk loud nor make any
noise in getting their lessons. A Boy&rsquo;s Tongue should never
be heard, but in saying his Lesson, asking or Answering a
Question.</p>
<p>9. That there be no buying, selling, changing, laying
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Wagers or Gaming in School-time, on the forfeiture of the
whole so bought or sold, etc.</p>
<p>10. That those who learn French shall not speak English
to any that learn French, on the Forfeiture of ye Bill, or one
Hour&rsquo;s Exercize after School Time.</p>
<p>11. That such as learn Latin are also oblig&rsquo;d not to speak
other Language to those that learn it, during School time, on
the Penalty last mentioned.</p>
<p>12. That all perform their Lessons and Exercises in fair
Writing and true Spelling, and likewise prepare themselves for
their Examinations in French, Latin, Accounts and Catechisms
every week, both in School times and all Vacations.</p>
<p>13. That such as perform well, shall be prefer&rsquo;d according
to their Merit, and shall have liberty to leave School before the
usual Time; but such as are Negligent herein, shall have
their Exercizes to write over again after School.</p>
<p>14. That none presume to call any Party or Nick-names
nor give any ill or reproachful Language, much less Curse,
Sware, or Lye, but in all things behave in a quiet, peaceable,
and civil manner.</p>
<p>15. That the Boarders shall not go beyond y<sup>e</sup> bounds
belonging to y<sup>e</sup> House on any pretence whatsoever without
leave, on the forfeiture of 6d. or two Hours&rsquo; Exercize after
School for Every such Offence.</p>
<p>16. That one Scholar is not to strike another, or challenge
him to fight; but in case of any Difference shall acquaint the
Master therewith and be satisfied with his Determination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst acquiring Greek at the public school, Priestley
learned Hebrew on holidays of the Dissenting minister
of the place, Mr Kirkby, under whose care he eventually
came.</p>
<p>The weakly, consumptive habit into which he now
fell necessitated his withdrawal from school. His
fondness for books had led his aunt to encourage the
hope that he might be trained for the ministry, and he
readily entered into her views.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;my ill health obliged me to turn my
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
thoughts another way, and, with a view to trade, I learned the
modern languages, French, Italian and High Dutch
[German], without a master; and in the first and last of them
I translated and wrote letters for an uncle of mine who was a
merchant, and who intended to put me into a counting-house
in Lisbon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, he says a house was actually engaged to
receive him there, and everything was nearly ready for
his undertaking the voyage when his health so far
improved that the idea of the ministry was resumed.
During the two years in which he had been kept away
from school the boy was thrown almost entirely upon
his own resources. It says much for the activity and
eagerness of his mind, his diligence and his power of
mental acquisitiveness, that he should have neglected no
opportunity of gaining knowledge from the various
heretical divines who came to drink a dish of tea with
his aunt. He tells us that from Mr Haggerstone, a
Dissenting minister in the neighbourhood, who had been
educated under Maclaurin, and whom he visited twice
a week, he learned geometry, algebra and various
branches of mathematics, theoretical and practical. He
also read, with but little assistance from him, Gravesend&rsquo;s
<i>Elements of Natural Philosophy</i>, Watts&rsquo;s <i>Logic</i>, and
Locke&rsquo;s <i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i>. &ldquo;He also
gave lessons in Hebrew to a Baptist minister at
Gildersome, a village about four miles from Leeds,
and by that means made himself &lsquo;a considerable
proficient in that language.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;At the same time I
learned Chaldee and Syriac, and just began to read
Arabic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As his knowledge increased, and the powers of his
intellect strengthened, he began to exercise his reason
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
upon the many problems of doctrine and religious
belief which could not fail to be uppermost in his mind
when his upbringing and the environment in which
circumstances had placed him are considered. His aunt,
although a strict Calvinist, was a large-minded woman,
and, as her nephew says, &ldquo;far from confining salvation
to those who thought as she did on religious subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Her home,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was the resort of all the dissenting
ministers in the neighbourhood, without distinction, and those
who were the most obnoxious, on account of their heresy, were
almost as welcome to her, if she thought them honest and good
men (which she was not unwilling to do), as any others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although all the religious books that came in his way
tended to confirm him in the principles of Calvinism,
he was led by the natural vigour of his mind, and by
an innate spirit of philosophical optimism, which
strengthened with advancing years, to feel a repugnance
to its gloomy tenets, and to question the
sufficiency and reasonableness of much of its doctrine.
The conversation of the heretical divines in whose
company he was thrown served, moreover, to awaken
inquiry and to increase his doubts. These divines were
for the most part men who, in liberality of thought,
were far in advance of the congregations they served,
and this was especially the case of those for whose attainments
and character the discerning boy had most respect.</p>
<p>The youth, who as a child had lisped at his
mother&rsquo;s knee, &ldquo;without missing a word,&rdquo; the formularies
of the Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism, was now tortured
with doubt and misgiving as he strove to penetrate into
and to realise the meaning of the phrases his memory so
tenaciously retained. And the more he read and the
more he pondered the more disquieted he became.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Having,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;read many books of <i>experiences</i>, and,
in consequence, believing that a <i>new birth</i>, produced by the
immediate agency of the Spirit of God, was necessary to salvation,
and not being able to satisfy myself that I <i>had</i> experienced
anything of the kind, I felt occasionally such distress of mind
as it is not in my power to describe, and which I still look
back upon with horror. Notwithstanding I had nothing very
material to reproach myself with, I often concluded that God
had forsaken me, and that mine was like the case of Francis
Spira, to whom, as he imagined, repentance and salvation were
denied. In that state of mind I remember reading the account
of the man in the iron cage in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>
with the greatest perturbation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;that even these conflicts of
mind were not without their use, as they led me to think habitually
of God and a future state. And though my feelings
were then, no doubt, too full of terror, what remained of them
was a deep reverence for divine things, and in time a pleasing
satisfaction which can never be effaced, and I hope was
strengthened as I have advanced in life and acquired more
rational notions of religion. The remembrance, however,
of what I sometimes felt in that state of ignorance and darkness
gives me a peculiar sense of the value of rational principles
of religion, and of which I can give but an imperfect description
to others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time he was greatly distressed that he could
not feel a proper repentance for the sin of Adam, taking
it for granted, he says, that without <i>this</i> it could not
be forgiven him. The fact was that, under the influence
of his friends, Haggerstone and Walker, he was insensibly
following Baxter in attempting to reconcile the
doctrines of Arminius and Calvin, and he ended by embracing
those of Arminius. It was repugnant to his
sense of equity and justice that, in the words of his
Catechism, &ldquo;All mankind, by the fall of our first
parents, lost communion with God, are under his
wrath and curse, and so made liable to all miseries in
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
this life, to death itself, and to the pains of hell for
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His first trial of faith came when he applied for
admission as a communicant in the congregation which
he had always attended. The old minister was willing
enough to receive him, but the elders, who had the
government of the church, discovering this unsoundness
on the subject of the sin of Adam, stoutly refused to
sanction his admission.</p>
<p>Whilst the taint of heresy appears not to have greatly
distressed the worthy Mrs Keighley, it doubtless added
to her difficulties in shaping his course towards the
ministry. In the natural order of things he was to
have been sent to the academy at Mile End, a hot-bed
of Calvinism, then under the care of Dr Cawder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;being at that time an Arminian, I
resolutely opposed it, especially upon finding that if I went
thither, besides giving an <i>experience</i>, I must subscribe my assent
to ten printed articles of the strictest Calvinistic faith, and
repeat it every six months.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It now looked as if the idea of the ministry was to
be given up for good and all, and given up it probably
would have been but for the intercession of Mr
Kirkby, who strongly recommended that he should be
placed under the care of the good and learned Dr
Doddridge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Kirby,&rdquo; says Priestley, &ldquo;had received a good education
himself, was a good classical scholar, and had no opinion of the
mode of education among the very orthodox Dissenters, and being
fond of me, he was desirous of my having every advantage that
could be procured for me. My good aunt, not being a bigoted
Calvinist, entered into his views.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley had another ally in his step-mother, for his
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
father had married again. She was a woman of good
sense as well as of religion, and had been sometime
housekeeper to Dr Doddridge, of whom she had a high
opinion, and had always recommended his academy.</p>
<p>To Dr Doddridge, however, he was not destined to
go. That eminent divine was in the last stages of the
malady to which he eventually succumbed, and he died
at Lisbon in the October of 1751.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Enters the Daventry Academy to be trained for the Ministry&mdash;Goes

Privations there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, in 1752, he was sent to Daventry, then
under the charge of Mr Ashworth. He was now
nineteen. Although of a weakly constitution, his
health was sufficiently re-established to enable him to
stand the strain of preparation for the calling to which
he now assiduously devoted himself. In mental equipments
he was so much in advance of his fellows that he
was excused all the studies of the first year and a great
part of those of the second. He remained at the
Academy three years.</p>
<p>No student ever dwelt more fondly on the memory of
his <i>Alma Mater</i> than did Priestley on Daventry and all
that it meant to him. Its atmosphere was wholly congenial
to him, steadying, stimulating and strengthening
the naturally vigorous powers of his mind. It was, he
says, peculiarly favourable to the serious pursuit of
truth, and every question of much importance, such as
liberty and necessity, the sleep of the soul, and all the
articles of theological orthodoxy and heresy were the
subjects of continual discussion between the teachers
and the taught. The general plan of studies was
exceedingly favourable to free inquiry: the students
were referred to authors on both sides of every question
and were required to give an account of them, abridging
the more important for future use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Concerning this small seminary for the training of
Dissenting ministers, the Rev. Mr Hargrove in his
account of Priestley in the <i>Inquirer</i> of 1904, says:<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A miserable little place it must have seemed to the eyes of
neighbouring clergy, with nothing in it of the venerable traditions,
the ancestral wealth, the beauty and the dignity of the old
colleges at Oxford and Cambridge. There was nothing grand
about this building, nor did any sacred associations hallow its
homeliness. But while the lamp of learning burnt low
in the ancient universities during the eighteenth century, their
gates kept fast closed against all who were too intelligent not
to doubt the doctrines of the Established Church, or too
honest to conceal their doubts, it burnt bright and clear, tiny
though the flame might be, in obscure and poor haunts like this
of Daventry. As Priestley proudly, and not untruly, boasted,
at a later time, to the Prime Minister of England:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shutting the doors of the universities against us, and keeping
the means of learning to yourselves, you may think to keep us
in ignorance and so less capable to give you disturbance. But
though ignominiously and unjustly excluded from the seats of
learning, and driven to the expedient of providing at a great
expense for scientific education among ourselves, we have had
this advantage, that our institutions, being formed in a more
enlightened age, are more liberal and therefore better calculated
to answer the purpose of a truly liberal education. Thus while
your universities resemble pools of stagnant water secured by
dams and mounds, ours are like rivers which, taking their natural
course, fertilise a whole country.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The manner in which he occupied his time, the range
of his studies, and the miscellaneous nature of his reading
at Daventry, may be seen from his following extract

<p>With one of his classmates he engaged to rise early
and so &ldquo;dispatched many articles of business every day.
One of them, which continued all the time we were at
the academy, was to read every day ten folio pages in
some Greek author, and generally a Greek play in the
course of the week besides. By this means we became
very well acquainted with that language and with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
most valuable authors in it.... My attention was always
more drawn to mathematical and philosophical studies
than his was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of his time at the academy,
and despite the attractions which scholarship and literary
studies had for him, and notwithstanding his eagerness
to satisfy &ldquo;the immense range of his curiosity in all
things, physical, moral or social,&rdquo; he never, he says, lost
sight of the great object of his studies, which was the
duties of a Christian minister.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There it was that I laid the general plan which I have
executed since. Particularly I there composed the first copy
of my <i>Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion</i>, Mr
Clark, to whom I communicated my scheme, carefully perusing
every section of it and talking over the subject of it with me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What three years of this mental, moral and intellectual
discipline meant to the young Arminian may
be summed up in his own words: he saw reason to
embrace what he says is usually called the heterodox
side of almost every question. And this notwithstanding
that Dr Ashworth was earnestly desirous of making
him as orthodox as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the great freedom of our speculations and
debates, the extreme of heresy among us was Arianism; and
all of us, I believe, left the academy with a belief, more or
less qualified, of the doctrine of <i>atonement</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley, even at this early stage in his career, gave
abundant proof of that resolute regard for truth which
constituted the motive power of his life. His sturdy
independence of thought, and his almost passionate resentment
of dogmatic authority&mdash;among the most significant
of his intellectual traits&mdash;were plainly manifested
in his youth and early manhood. They continued to
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the end to be the dominant notes of his character and to
be the springs of his action. They were at once the
sources of his strength and the causes of his misfortunes.</p>
<p>Priestley had now finished with Daventry. He was
twenty-two years of age, and ready, and indeed eager,
to minister in all the glory of a full-bottomed wig to
any congregation that might solicit his services.</p>
<p>The young divines at the academy were an unworldly
set, taking but little thought of their future situations in
life. They often, indeed, amused themselves, as Priestley
tells us, with the idea of their dispersion in all parts of
the kingdom, after living so happily together, and with
the <i>camaraderie</i> of youth used to propose plans of meeting
at certain times, and smile at the different appearances
they would probably make after being ten or
twenty years settled in the world.</p>
<p>Priestley set out on his career with the highest ideal
of his calling; indeed to him the office of a Christian
minister was the most honourable of any on earth, and
he had no other ambition than to distinguish himself by
his application to the studies proper to that profession.
That he laboured unselfishly and with no idea of place
and preferment is certain from the circumstance that he
suffered from a physical disability which he must have
recognised could not but tell strongly against his chance
of worldly success. He had an inveterate stammer which,
at times, made preaching as irksome to him as it was
trying to those who had to listen to him. In spite of
many and repeated attempts he never wholly overcame
this trial. And yet nothing is more characteristic of him
than, as he reviewed his career in the evening of his
life, he should see that, like St Paul&rsquo;s thorn in the flesh,
his impediment had not been without its use.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Without some such check as this,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I might have
been disputatious in company, or might have been seduced by
the love of popular applause as a preacher; whereas, my conversation
and my delivery in the pulpit having nothing in them
that was generally striking, I hope I have been more attentive
to qualifications of a superior kind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thorn in the flesh was probably not without its
use in other ways. It probably drove him to literature.
If he had none of the graces of pulpit oratory, he had at
least the gift of facile composition. If he could not
hope to move men&rsquo;s minds by oral appeals, he might
aspire to sway them by the power of the pen.</p>
<p>His first call came from an inconsiderable congregation
at Needham Market in Suffolk. It was a poor and
needy place, nominally under the charge of a superannuated
minister, the prospects bounded by the
possibilities attaching to a stipend of forty pounds a
year. And these prospects, limited as they were, were
still further curtailed by Priestley&rsquo;s own action. He found
that his congregation had been used to receive assistance
from both Presbyterian and Independent funds. Priestley
was no longer in the mood to receive assistance from
the Independents, and told his congregation that he
&ldquo;did not choose to have anything to do&rdquo; with that body.
That little difference between the elders and himself
concerning the sin of Adam and its consequence, together
with his three years&rsquo; sojourn at Daventry, were beginning
to bear fruit. The congregation readily consented to
give up the Independent fund and promised to make
good the deficiency themselves. Priestley, however,
quickly realised that they deceived themselves either as
to their ability or their willingness to redeem this
promise, for the most, he says, he ever received from
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
them was in the proportion of about thirty pounds per
annum. They also deceived him in another sense.
Their readiness in consenting to do without the assistance
of the Independents disposed him to think &ldquo;they could
not have much bigotry among them.&rdquo; Although he
made it a rule to introduce nothing in the pulpit that
could, or should, lead to controversy, he made no secret
of his real opinions in conversation, or in his lectures on
the theory of religion which he had composed at the
academy and which he proceeded to give to all persons,
without distinction of sex or age, who chose to come
and listen to him. He then found that when he came
to treat of the Unity of God merely as an article of
religion his hearers were attentive to nothing but the
soundness of his faith in the doctrine of the Trinity, and
they quickly discovered, what he was at no pains to
conceal, that he was a very pronounced Arian. From
the time of this discovery, he says, his hearers fell off
apace, especially as the old minister, as might have been
expected, took a decided part against him. To add to
his difficulties his aunt stopped his remittances. This
was in part due to the ill offices of his orthodox, <i>i.e.</i>,
Independent, relations, but mainly because the worthy
Mrs Keighley had largely exhausted her liberality in
supporting others of her needy dependants, and in
particular a deformed niece, her constant companion, and
who could not, Priestley thinks, have subsisted without
the greatest part, at least, of all she had to bequeath.
He himself was the first to recognise that, being
apparently settled in the world, he ought to be no longer
burdensome to her. She had spared no expense in his
education, and that, he says, was doing more for him
than giving him an estate. Whatever the world might
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
have thought as to his being settled in it, it had little
to offer him beyond the dignity of his profession, and
it is difficult to live on dignity alone. The respectable
and agreeable families in the place, to whom he had
flattered himself he would be useful, were not very
prompt to support that dignity, and eventually it had
to sustain itself on the wages of an agricultural labourer.
Indeed, he says, had it not been for the good offices of
Dr Benson and Dr Kippis, eminent eighteenth century
divines, who procured him &ldquo;now and then an extraordinary
five pounds from different charities,&rdquo; he believed
he should have starved.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At Needham&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I felt the effect of a low, despised
situation, together with that arising from the want of popular
talents. There were several vacancies in congregations in that
neighbourhood where my sentiments would have been no
objection to me, but I was never thought of. Even my next
neighbour, whose sentiments were as free as my own, and known
to be so, declined making exchanges with me, which, when I
left that part of the country, he acknowledged was not owing
to any dislike his people had to me as heretical, but for other
reasons, the more genteel part of his hearers always absenting
themselves when they heard I was to preach for him. But
visiting that country some years afterwards, when I had raised
myself to some degree of notice in the world, and being invited
to preach in that very pulpit, the same people crowded to hear
me, though my elocution was not much improved, and they
professed to admire one of the same discourses they had
formerly despised.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The iron would have entered the soul of a weaker
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
man, but Priestley, true to himself, never lost hope or
faltered in his courage. However short his commons,
Providence had endowed him with the continual feast of
a contented mind. He firmly believed, even during the
darkest hours of that Suffolk time, that this same wise
Providence was disposing everything for the best.
Notwithstanding his unfavourable circumstances, &ldquo;I
was,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;far from being unhappy at Needham.&rdquo;
He boarded with a family for whose kindness he was
always grateful. He had free access to one or two
private libraries in the district, in particular one belonging
to Mr Alexander, a Quaker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Here it was,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that I was first acquainted with
any person of that persuasion; and I must acknowledge my
obligation to many of them in every future stage of my life. I
have met with the noblest instances of liberality of sentiment
and the truest generosity among them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There can be little doubt, however, in spite of his
robust optimism and the courage with which he confronted
the world, the young divine led a cheerless and
solitary existence at Needham. And it is no less
certain that it was during this dark and troubled time
that he sowed the seed&mdash;the wheat and the tares&mdash;which
in the fulness of time was to furnish the harvest
of good and evil he eventually garnered&mdash;fame, obloquy,
insult, persecution, respect, affection and his position
among the immortals.</p>
<p>Although the account which Priestley has left us of
his life and work at Needham is somewhat meagre, it is
sufficiently full to enable us to trace in it the initial
stages of his evolution as a theological thinker. Indeed,
he says his studies at this period were chiefly theological,
theology being the business of his life and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
vocation to which he had been called. He had left the
academy with a qualified belief in the doctrine of
atonement, and as he was desirous of getting some
more definite ideas on the subject he set himself to
peruse the whole of the Old and New Testament and
to collect from them, with the greatest care, all the
texts that appeared to him to have any relation to the
subject, and to arrange them under a great variety of
heads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The consequence of this was,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;what I had no
apprehension of when I began the work, viz., a full persuasion
that the doctrine of atonement, even in its most qualified sense,
had no countenance either from Scripture or reason.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then proceeded to digest his observations into a
regular treatise, a part only of which was at that time
published, under the title of the <i>Doctrine of Remission</i>.
The portion omitted had reference to an examination
of the writings of the Apostle Paul, whose reasoning,
he was satisfied, was in many places far from being
conclusive. This examination grew into a separate
work, in which he tested every passage in which the
reasoning appeared to him to be defective or the conclusions
ill-supported; and, as he says, he thought them
to be pretty numerous.</p>
<p>His friend Kippis advised him to publish this treatise
under the character of an unbeliever, in order to draw
the more attention to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I did not choose, having always had a
great aversion to assume any character that was not my own,
even so much as disputing for the sake of discovering truth. I
cannot ever say that I was quite reconciled to the idea of
writing to a fictitious person, as in my <i>Letters to a Philosophical
Unbeliever</i>, though nothing can be more innocent, or sometimes
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
more proper, our Saviour&rsquo;s parables implying a much greater
departure from strict truth than those letters do. I therefore
wrote the book with great freedom indeed, but as a Christian
and an admirer of the Apostle Paul, as I always was in other
respects.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When nine sheets of the work were printed off, Dr
Kippis dissuaded him from proceeding, or indeed from
publishing anything of the kind, until he should be more
known and his character better established, and accordingly
he desisted. All that he considered of consequence
in this work he subsequently inserted in the <i>Theological
Repository</i>, &ldquo;in order to its being submitted to the
examination of learned Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another task that he imposed on himself at Needham,
and in part executed, was an accurate comparison of the
Hebrew text of the Hagiographa and the Prophets with
the version of the Septuagint, noting all the variations.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, in connection with this inquiry that
his name appears in the second list of subscribers to
Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Hebrew Concordance</i>, the second volume of
which was published in 1757. The subscription was
three guineas, a very considerable sum to the young
divine in those days. The fact that he should have
entered his name at all is an indication of the ardour
and spirit of self-sacrifice with which he invariably
pursued his inquiries, whether theological or scientific.</p>
<p>Priestley, to the end of his days, cared little for
money except as the means of procuring the material
for his investigations, and he was always ready to part
with it, to the extent of his opportunity, in any cause in
which his sympathies were enlisted.</p>
<p>His circumstances were now so straitened that,
despite the great aversion which he conceived he had to
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
the business of a schoolmaster&mdash;having often said that he
would have recourse to anything else for a maintenance
in preference to it&mdash;he was at length compelled to make
some attempt that way. He therefore printed and
distributed proposals to teach classics, mathematics, etc.,
for half a guinea a quarter, and to board the pupils in
the house with himself for twelve guineas a year. It
was recognised that he was not unqualified for this
work, but although there was no obvious connection
between Arianism and arithmetic it was enough that he
was tainted with heresy, and not a pupil was entrusted to
his care.</p>
<p>He then proposed to give lectures to grown persons
on such branches of science as he could procure the
means of illustrating, and began with a course of twelve
lectures on the use of &ldquo;A New and Correct Globe of
the Earth.&rdquo; His one course of ten hearers did little more
than pay for his globes.</p>
<p>At this juncture a distant relative procured him an
opportunity of preaching as a candidate at Sheffield, but
his trial sermon was not approved: his manner was
thought &ldquo;too gay and airy.&rdquo; One of the ministers at
Sheffield had, however, more discrimination, and by his
good offices he was recommended to a congregation at
Nantwich, in Cheshire, who gave him an invitation to
preach there for a year certain. Accordingly, he put
together his few worldly possessions&mdash;his globes, his
beloved books, his stock of sermons, and the manuscripts
of the theological treatises he was too poor or too
diffident to give to the world&mdash;and took the Ipswich
packet to London as the least expensive way of getting
down to Cheshire.</p>
<p>The chapel in which Priestley preached at Needham
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
was taken down and rebuilt in 1837. When Rutt was
preparing his edition of Priestley&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>, his
daughter, Mrs Notcutt, who lived in Ipswich, made
inquiries respecting Priestley, but with no result.</p>
<p>No reminiscences of him could be found at Needham.
He was evidently thought too poor and too obscure for
his memory to be treasured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Goes to Nantwich&mdash;Starts a School&mdash;Is appointed a Tutor in
the Warrington Academy&mdash;Life at Warrington.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley left Needham Market in 1758. He had
been there three years, and he was in his twenty-fifth
year when he entered upon his work at Nantwich. Of
this place he had always the happiest recollections.
The meeting-house, as we learn from Partridge&rsquo;s
<i>Historical Account of Nantwich</i>, 1774, was a good, decent
building, &ldquo;to which appertains a convenient house for
the minister.&rdquo; Whether he actually occupied this house
is uncertain. One account states that he boarded
with Mr John Eddowes, a grocer, and sometimes
showed his agility and sprightliness by leaping over the
counter. Eddowes was described by Priestley as a very
sociable and sensible man, and as he was fond of music
his guest was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Induced to learn to play a little on the English flute, as
the easiest instrument;&rdquo; and, he continues, &ldquo;though I was
never a proficient in it, my playing contributed more or less to
my amusement many years of my life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he adds,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I would recommend the knowledge and practice of music to
all studious persons; and it will be better for them if, like myself,
they should have no very fine ear or exquisite taste, as by this
means they will be more easily pleased and be less apt to be
offended when the performances they hear are but indifferent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Nantwich he found the people good-natured and
friendly, and happily free from those controversies
which had been the topics of almost every conversation
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
in Suffolk. He had indeed little mind for them himself.
His congregation never exceeded sixty persons,
and a great proportion of them were travelling Scotchmen,
men, he says, of very good sense, and, what he thought
extraordinary, not one of them at all Calvinistical. As
there were few children in the congregation there
was little scope for exertion with respect to his duty in
catechising.</p>
<p>As the duties of his office left him ample opportunity
to turn the active powers of his mind to account, he
again attempted to establish a school, and this time with
a success far beyond his anticipations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My school,&rdquo; he states, &ldquo;consisted of about thirty boys,
and I had a separate room for about half a dozen young ladies.
Thus I was employed from seven in the morning until four in
the afternoon, without any interval except one hour for dinner,
and I never gave a holiday on any consideration, the red-letter
days, as they are called, excepted. I had, therefore, but little
leisure for reading or for improving myself in any way, except
what necessarily arose from my employment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley, in truth, was an excellent teacher, and with
the success which his efforts brought him there passed
away the last traces of the aversion with which he had
entered on that calling. He made it his study to
regulate his business as a schoolmaster in the best
manner, and he was able to say with truth that in no
school was more business done, or with more satisfaction,
either to the master or the scholars, than in this
school of his.</p>
<p>He was no longer haunted, as at Needham, with the
fear of debt, and he was able to add to his stock of
books and to gratify his wish to possess some
philosophical instruments, such as a small air-pump
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
and an electrical machine, which he taught his pupils to
use and to keep in order, and by entertaining their
parents and friends with experiments he added greatly
to the reputation of his school. At that time, however,
he had no leisure to make any original observations.</p>
<p>Such leisure as he had he gave to literature, recomposing
his <i>Observations on the Character and
Reasoning of the Apostle Paul</i>, which he began at
Needham, and compiling an English grammar for the
use of his school, on a new plan. This work, which
was printed in 1761, had a considerable reputation in its
day. David Hume acknowledged to Griffith, the bookseller,
that he was made sensible of the Gallicisms and
peculiarities of his style on reading it.</p>
<p>Priestley remained three years at Nantwich. His
success there as a teacher induced the trustees of the
newly-founded academy at Warrington to reconsider
the desirability of engaging him as tutor in the Classical
Languages and in what used to be called Polite Literature.
His name had already been mentioned in connection
with the Warrington Academy by his friend, Clark of
Daventry, at the time of its establishment and whilst he
was at Needham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Priestley, &ldquo;Mr (afterwards Dr) Aikin,
whose qualifications were superior to mine, was justly
preferred to me.&rdquo; On the death, on March 5, 1761, of
Dr John Taylor of Norwich, the learned author of
<i>A Hebrew Concordance</i> and other theological works, and
a well-known classical scholar, the head of the academy
and its tutor of divinity, Dr Aikin was appointed to
succeed him, and Priestley was invited to take Dr
Aikin&rsquo;s place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says Priestley, &ldquo;I accepted, though my school
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
promised to be more gainful to me. But my employment at
Warrington would be more liberal and less painful. But, as I
told the persons who brought me the invitation, I should have
preferred the office of teaching the Mathematics and Natural
Philosophy, for which I had at that time a great predilection.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s removal to Warrington, in September
1761, was one of the turning-points in his career, and
no single circumstance in it exercised a greater influence
on his life and fortunes. &ldquo;The Warrington Academy
for the education of young men of every religious
denomination for the Christian ministry, or as laymen,&rdquo;
and the men who formed its tutors, played a notable
part in the history of Nonconformity in England. In
Taylor of Norwich; in Aikin, the father of the well-known
physician and lecturer on Natural History, and
of Anna L&aelig;titia, better known as Mrs Barbauld, the
poetess; in John Reinhold Forster, the naturalist,
who accompanied Cook in his second voyage; in
Nicholas Clayton, who succeeded Aikin as divinity
tutor; in William Enfield, the author of the <i>History
of Liverpool</i> and the well-known compiler of <i>The Speaker</i>,
who afterwards became <i>Rector Academic&aelig;</i>; in Pendlebury
Houghton, and in Gilbert Wakefield, the accomplished
editor of <i>Lucretius</i>, Priestley had for colleagues or
successors as eminent a set of teachers as any place of
learning at that time could boast of. It was at the
Warrington Academy, the successor of the older
academies belonging to the English Presbyterian body
at Findern and Kendal, and the direct ancestor of the
Manchester College at Oxford, that the free thought of
English Presbyterianism first began to crystallise into
the Unitarian theology, and for a time it was the centre
of literary taste and activity, and of political liberalism
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
of the district in which it was placed&mdash;the Areopagus
in the Athens of Lancashire, as it was called.</p>
<p>The <i>Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire
and Cheshire</i> (vol xi. p. I, 1858-59) contain
&ldquo;A Historical Sketch of Warrington Academy,&rdquo; by Mr
Henry A. Bright, compiled in great measure from a
parcel of papers, letters and memoranda which had
belonged to the Rev. J. Seddon, and which had been
rescued from the hands of a Liverpool cheesemonger,
who was using them for the ordinary purposes of his
shop. Among these papers were letters of Priestley,
Kippis, Aikin and others of lesser note, all of interest
as throwing light on the history of the academy. I am
indebted to Mr Bright&rsquo;s paper for the following account
of the character and fortunes of the academy. Mr
John Seddon, we learn, was its virtual founder. The
letters referred to, as well as the testimony of contemporaries,
bear witness to &ldquo;the concern which he
had ever expressed for its support, honour, success;
the indefatigable pains which he took for this purpose;
the indifference which he showed to fame or censure,
to good or evil report, so that he might serve the
general designs of the institution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seddon, although described as &ldquo;a dullish person,&rdquo;
must have been a man of considerable pertinacity,
patience and resource, as shown by the manner in
which he steered his venture through the difficulties and
dangers incident to its establishment, for he had to
contend with the doubts, hesitation and luke-warmness
of its professed supporters, and the &ldquo;pleasing
spirit of jealous rivalry&rdquo; which existed between Liverpool
and Manchester as to its locality. Liverpool
advanced seven &ldquo;excellent reasons&rdquo; why the academy
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
should <i>not</i> be settled at Warrington; of these one of
the Manchester party writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Some of them are <i>false</i>,
others <i>dubious</i>, and all, whether true or not, <i>trifling</i> and
<i>impertinent</i>.&rdquo; This &ldquo;retort courteous&rdquo; was naturally
followed by &ldquo;Remarks on a letter from the gentlemen
in Manchester to the gentlemen in Liverpool, subscribers
to the intended Academy,&rdquo; in which &ldquo;the
gentlemen in Liverpool&rdquo; lose their temper most completely.
Every fourth word in the remarks is italicised.
&ldquo;The gentlemen of Manchester,&rdquo; are stigmatised as &ldquo;the
authors of contention and division,&rdquo; and are subjected
to much scathing sarcasm. Evidently the omens were
not very propitious, but the wordy warfare eventually
spent itself. Mr Seddon got his way; the trustees
ultimately settled down to business and on June 30,
1757, the academy was duly inaugurated.</p>
<p>Its first home, immortalised by the lines in which
Mrs Barbauld bids us</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Mark where its simple front yon mansion rears,</p>
<p class="t0">The nursery of men for future years,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>was described, in terms eminently suggestive of the incomparable
Mr George Robins, as &ldquo;a range of
buildings&rdquo; with &ldquo;a considerable extent of garden ground,
and a handsome terrace walk on the banks of the
Mersey, possessing altogether a respectable collegiate
appearance.&rdquo; The &ldquo;ugly, mean, old brick house,&rdquo; no
longer</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A dim old mansion, hidden half-away</p>
<p class="t0">From a dull world grown careless of its fame,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>has been transformed into a place of quiet, old-world
dignity, and is now turned to uses worthy of its fame
and in harmony with its traditions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>In spite of the seeming unanimity of the trustees, and
the zeal and energy of their secretary, Mr Seddon, the
fortunes of the Academy were ill-starred from the outset.
Dr Taylor, one of the first Arians who ministered
to the English Presbyterians, and an erudite and accomplished
man&mdash;an author so widely read in his day
that he is even mentioned by Burns in his Epistle to
John Goudie:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis you and Taylor are the chief,</p>
<p class="t0">Wha are to blame for this mischief&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>was ill fitted to direct the precarious existence of the
enterprise, and the old scholar must have sighed often
for the free and independent position, and the dear home
among an affectionate people, which he had sacrificed in
leaving Norwich for Warrington. Dissensions arose, in
the midst of which Dr Taylor died.</p>
<p>Dr Taylor, as already stated, was succeeded as
theological tutor by Dr Aikin, who retained that position
until his death in 1780.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dr Aikin,&rdquo; says Gilbert Wakefield, &ldquo;was a gentleman
whose endowments as a man and as a scholar it is not easy to
exaggerate by panegyric.... His intellectual attainments
were of a very superior quality indeed. His acquaintance
with all true evidences of revelation, with morals, politics and
metaphysics, was most accurate and extensive. Every path of
polite literature had been traversed by him, and traversed with
success. He understood the Hebrew and French languages
to perfection, and had an intimacy with the best authors of
Greece and Rome superior to what I have ever known in any
Dissenting minister from my own experience.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under his judicious guidance matters now went more
smoothly: indeed, the eighteen or twenty years which
followed constituted the golden age of the Academy,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
and the brightest and happiest of these were the six
years of Priestley&rsquo;s stay.</p>
<p>In the year following Taylor&rsquo;s death the academy
moved from the house by &ldquo;Mersey&rsquo;s gentle current,&rdquo;
then, we are told, an uncontaminated stream noted for its
salmon, to the new Academy, which is described as a
brick building in a quiet and secluded court, with stone
copings and a clock and bell turret in the centre, of no
great architectural beauty, but not unpleasing with its
quaint, old-world look. This, too, was celebrated in
verse by Mrs Barbauld:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lo! there the seat where science loved to dwell,</p>
<p class="t0">Where liberty her ardent spirit breathed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It exists no longer: municipal improvements have
swept it away, and all that remains of Academy Place
are the houses at right angles to it where dwelt Priestley
and Enfield. As to emoluments, the tutors had each
&pound;100 a year from the subscription fund, and &ldquo;with
respect to dwelling houses, are to be at their own expenses.&rdquo;
Poor students were exempted from the
payment of fees, but richer ones paid two guineas yearly
to each of the tutors, who might take boarders into
their houses at &pound;15 per annum for those who had two
months&rsquo; vacation, and &pound;18 per annum for those who
had no vacation, exclusive of &ldquo;tea, washing, fire and
candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the living at Warrington was plain and the thinking
high, there was a degree of decorous gaiety, of
refinement, of social charm, &ldquo;easy, blithe and debonnair,&rdquo;
pervading the little community, which, as may be
gleaned from the memoirs and reminiscences of the period,
impressed and delighted everyone who was witness of
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
it. Among those who had pleasant memories of the
place were John Howard, the philanthropist, whose
works on prison reform were printed by Eyres of
Warrington under Dr Aikin&rsquo;s superintendence;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> William
Roscoe, the author of the <i>Lives of Lorenzo de
Medici</i> and <i>Leo the Tenth</i>, who first learned to care for
botany from his visits to the Warrington Botanical
Gardens, and whose first work, <i>Mount Pleasant</i>, was also
printed there; Pennant, the naturalist, whose <i>British
Zoology</i> and <i>Tour in Scotland</i> first saw the light at Warrington;
Currie, the biographer of Burns, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The tutors in my time,&rdquo; wrote Priestley&mdash;(&ldquo;they
knew better,&rdquo; said Miss Lucy Aikin, &ldquo;than to usurp the title of
<i>Professors</i>&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;lived in the most perfect harmony. We drank
tea together every Saturday, and our conversation was equally
instructive and pleasing. I often thought it not a little extraordinary
that four persons who had no previous knowledge of
each other should have been brought to unite in conducting
such a scheme as this, and be all zealous <i>Necessarians</i> as we
were. We were all, likewise, Arians; and the only subject
of much consequence on which we differed respected the
doctrine of atonement, concerning which Dr Aikin held some
obscure notions. The only Socinian in the neighbourhood was
Mr Seddon of Manchester, and we all wondered at him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Lucy Aikin, the granddaughter of Priestley&rsquo;s
colleague, the niece of Mrs Barbauld, and the accomplished
authoress of <i>Memoirs of the Courts of Queen
Elizabeth</i>, and the biographer of Addison, has left us a
little sketch of that society in which the early years of
her girlhood were spent.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have often thought,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;with envy of that
society. Neither Oxford nor Cambridge could boast of
brighter names in literature or science than several of those
Dissenting tutors&mdash;humbly content, in an obscure town and on
a scanty pittance, to cultivate in themselves, and communicate
to a rising generation, those mental acquirements and moral
habits which are their own exceeding great reward. They
and theirs lived together like one large family, and in the
facility of their intercourse they found large compensation for
its deficiency in luxury and splendour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we learn there were other attractions in the Warrington
circle besides the tutors and their philosophy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have a knot of lasses just after your own heart,&rdquo;
writes Mrs Barbauld (then Miss Aikin) to her friend Miss
Belsham, &ldquo;as merry, blithe and gay as you would wish them,
and very smart and clever&mdash;two of them are the Miss Rigbys.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are further told the beautiful Miss Rigbys,
whose father was &ldquo;provider of the Commons,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;made wild work with the students&rsquo; hearts; and the trustees
had to insist that they must be removed from the house if any
students stayed there. And so for a time they were, but Mrs
Rigby&rsquo;s health fortunately broke down, and the young ladies
were brought back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rousseau&rsquo;s <i>Heloise</i>, too, had much to answer for, and at
its appearance (so Miss Aikin tells me), &lsquo;everybody instantly
fell in love with everybody&rsquo;; and then it was that our poetess,
after winning the hearts of half the students, some one or two
of whom for her sake lived (I am informed) &lsquo;sighing and
single,&rsquo; was carried off to Palgrave by that queer little man
whom henceforth she was to &lsquo;honour and obey.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On another occasion she wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody was bold enough to talk of getting up private
theatricals. This was a dreadful business! All the wise and
grave, the whole tutorhood, cried out, &lsquo;It must not be!&rsquo;
The students, the Rigbys and, I must add, my aunt, took the
prohibition very sulkily, and my aunt&rsquo;s Ode to Wisdom was the
result.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Those wicked Miss Rigbys must have made the life
of that &ldquo;dullish person,&rdquo; Mr Seddon, who acted as
<i>Rector Academi&aelig;</i>, and who was responsible for law and
order, well-nigh insupportable. On one occasion&mdash;perhaps
it was to celebrate their return&mdash;they asked
some of the students to supper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hams and trifles, and potted beef and other luxuries, were
placed before them, and the students were asked to help the
ladies. But the hams were made of wood, and the trifles were
plates of soap-suds, and the potted beef was potted sawdust,
and the other luxuries were equally tempting and equally
tantalising.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor were the Rector&rsquo;s feelings likely to be soothed
by such letters as the following from Mr Samuel
Vaughan of Bristol, sent during the Long Vacation,
complaining bitterly of the disappointment he felt as
regards the Academy, and the &ldquo;too great latitude allowed
the students&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My son Ben&rsquo;s expenses during ten months&rsquo; absence
amounted to &pound;112, and Billy&rsquo;s to &pound;59, 12s.; this should
nearly suffice for the University, and of itself would to many
be a sufficient objection, but in my opinion the consequence
of the expense is abundantly more pernicious, as it naturally
leads to Levity, a love of pleasure, dissipation and affectation
of smartness; diverts the attention, and prevents the necessary
application to serious thoughts and Study. When I sent my
Sons so great a distance, it was with a view to preserve them
from the reigning contagion of a dissipated age, to imbibe good
Morals, acquire knowledge, and to obtain a manly and solid
way of thinking and acting, but they are returned with high
Ideas of modern refinements, of dress and external accomplishments,
which if ever necessary, yet resumed by them much too
soon. As one instance, they think it a Sight to appear without
having their hair Frissened, and this must be done by a dresser,
even upon the Sabbath. No person can more wish for, and
encourage an open and Liberal way of thinking and acting than
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
myself, yet do I think that day should be kept with Ancient
Solemnity, for to say the least, the reverse gives offence to
many serious good People, and exhibits an Ill example at a
time when Religion is at so low an ebb as to stand in need of
every tie and prop (whether real or imaginary) for its support,
therefore any relaxation or Innovation under sanction of such a
seminary as yours may have the most pernicious tendency, for
when restraints even in unessentials are removed they are frequently
a clue or gradation to the fashionable levity of the Age
and Irreligion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the <i>mauvais quart d&rsquo;heure</i> under the ancestral
roof was not without its chastening influence on the
improvident Ben is evident from the fact that the same
post brought the perturbed Rector a letter from him
protesting that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;none of us have been vicious but only gay.... Our recreations
have been innocent though expensive, but they imagine that
they cannot be expensive without being criminal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, he expresses contrition and promises amendment,
fears that he has encroached on Mr Seddon&rsquo;s
goodness and forbearance, and that his conduct may
have acted injuriously on the Academy, etc., etc., and
winds up by saying that Mr Wilkes will probably get a
pardon from the Crown, and that he (Mr Vaughan) does
not believe that he ever wrote the <i>North Briton</i>&mdash;No. 45.</p>
<p>Alas! Mr Benjamin Vaughan&rsquo;s contrition was very
short-lived, for next year that &ldquo;affectionate but distressed
pupil&rdquo; had to confess to the Rector that he dare not
show his accounts to his father.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My father, last year, was extremely angry at an account
I gave him of &pound;112 spent at Warrington&mdash;the present sum is
&pound;179. Bill disclaims all share in the expenses above &pound;60. <i>I</i>
then have &pound;119 to answer for; <i>I</i> who promised such a strict
amendment, and who had as many excuses last year as at
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
present. I had more journeys, more music, and yet, according
to his knowledge, have spent &pound;7 more in my present year of
pennance, repentance, etc.!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet Mr Benjamin Vaughan became a useful
member of society, had a seat in the House of Commons,
and had the honour of having dedicated to him the
<i>Lectures on History and General Policy</i>, to which is
prefixed an &ldquo;Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for
Civil and Active Life,&rdquo; to which he had listened as a
pupil and which Priestley published in 1788.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been Mr Seddon&rsquo;s worries he had
at least the consolation of a loving wife, although, it is
to be feared, she too suffered much at the hands of
those terrible Miss Rigbys, and even from Miss Aikin,
who was somewhat of a quiz. The daughter of an
equerry to Frederick Prince of Wales, she was a very
fine lady, and, says Mr Bright, &ldquo;spelt abominably.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Among the Seddon papers is a letter which her husband
wrote to her during a short absence in 1766. On the back of
his letter Mrs Seddon prepares a rough draft of an answer to
her truant husband. The word which puzzles her most is
&lsquo;adieu,&rsquo; and she has to spell it over three times before she can
determine whether the &lsquo;e&rsquo; comes before the &lsquo;i,&rsquo; or the &lsquo;i&rsquo;
before the &lsquo;e.&rsquo; The knotty point is at last settled and the fair
copy written out; and this, too, her careful husband put away
and preserved among his papers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot resist quoting the last paragraph of this
most charming but laborious letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hear of you as often as you can; for it does me
more good, and has a much stronger <i>a</i>ffect upon my spirits
than either e<i>a</i>ther or salvolatiley. Adieu, my dear, <i>e</i>xcept the
sincerest and best wishes for your health and happiness, of one
whose greatest pleasure in this world is in subscribing herself
your truely affectionate wife.&mdash;<span class="sc">J. Seddon.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I shall want cash before you return; what must I
doe? Pray put me in a way how to replenish. Remember
me propperly to everybody.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We cannot, however, concern ourselves at greater
length with the life at the Warrington Academy, or
dwell much longer on the fortunes of that seat of
learning. To do full justice to the theme would need
indeed the witty pen which in &ldquo;Cranford&rdquo; delineated
the social life of a neighbouring town with such
inimitable grace and charm.</p>
<p>The worthy Mr Seddon died in 1770, and was
succeeded as Rector by Dr Enfield, a man distinguished
for elegance of taste and sound literary judgment,
and who, on the death, ten years later, of Dr Aikin,
became chief tutor. For various reasons, which it is
unnecessary to state here, the trustees eventually decided
to remove the Academy to Manchester, and Warrington
knew it no more after 1786.</p>
<p>During the twenty-nine years of its existence in the
latter place some 400 pupils had passed through it&mdash;many
of them noteworthy men in their day, such as
Percival; the Aikins; Rigby of Norwich; Estlin of
Bristol; Sergeant Heywood; Hamilton Rowan, the
Irish rebel; Malthus, the political economist; Lord
Ennismore; Sir James Carnegie of Southesk; Mr Henry
Beaton, Mr Pendlebury Houghton and Dr Crompton.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In looking over the students&rsquo; names,&rdquo; says Mr Bright, &ldquo;I
cannot but notice how many of their descendants are still the
staunch supporters of the liberal dissent which was the distinguishing
characteristic of the Academy. Some families, like
the Willoughbys of Parkham, whose last lord was educated at
Warrington, have now died out; others, like the Aldersons of
Norwich, of which family the late judge was a member, have
seceded to the Church of England. But we still find united the
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
lineal and the theological successors of the Academy&rsquo;s students
in the Rigbys, the Martineaus, and the Taylors of Norwich,
the Heywoods and the Yateses of Liverpool, the Potters of
Manchester, the Gaskells of Wakefield, the Brights of Bristol,
the Shores of Sheffield, the Hibberts of Hyde, and the
Wedgwoods of Etruria.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Priestley marries&mdash;Is ordained&mdash;His Essay on Education&mdash;Lectures
on History and General Policy&mdash;His Chart
of Biography&mdash;Becomes a Doctor of Laws of the
University of Edinburgh&mdash;His visits to London&mdash;Makes
the acquaintance of Dr Price, Canton and
Benjamin Franklin&mdash;Writes the <i>History of Electricity</i>&mdash;Is
elected into the Royal Society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s entrance into the Warrington community
affected his career in more ways than one. In the first
place, the improvements in his worldly prospects enabled
him to marry; and in the second he was led to turn his
attention to Natural Philosophy, to which, as we have
seen, he was already predisposed. The selection of his
wife and of his studies influenced the subsequent course
of his life profoundly. Why he should have left
the sprightly, witty &ldquo;Nancy Aikin, with the blue and
laughing eyes,&rdquo; to be &ldquo;carried off to Palgrave by that
queer little man&rdquo; whom she had to &ldquo;honour and
obey&rdquo; as a school-mistress, is one of those inscrutable
dispensations which the hymeneal god delights in.
That they were the best of friends and had pleasure in
each other&rsquo;s society is abundantly evident. Priestley
warmly admired her genius: she confessed, indeed, that
he first encouraged her to try her &rsquo;prentice hand at
poetry. She was about eighteen when Priestley first
appeared at Warrington, and about ten years his junior,
a girl of many personal attractions and, as demonstrated
by her writings, of great mental ability and accomplishments.
She had been carefully educated by her father,
had a considerable knowledge of modern literature, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
was fairly well-read in that of Greece and Rome. Her
first volume of poems was printed at Warrington in
1773 and ran through four editions in a year. It was
said of her that she roused the admiration of Fox and
Johnson, the envy of Rogers and Wordsworth, and the
jealousy of Goldsmith; Scott declared she made a poet
of him; Brougham eulogised her in the House of
Lords, and Mrs Oliphant has paid her a beautiful tribute
in her <i>Literary History of England</i>.</p>
<p>Miss Lucy Aikin, in her edition of her aunt&rsquo;s collected
works, gives a charming description of her as she
appeared in early womanhood:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;She was at this time possessed of great beauty, distinct
traces of which she retained to the latest period of her life.
Her person was slender, her complexion exquisitely fair, with
the bloom of perfect health; her features were regular and
elegant, and her dark blue eyes beamed with the light of wit
and fancy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not less charming is the testimony of Henry Crabb
Robinson, who, in 1805, wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Barbauld bore the remains of great personal beauty.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
She had a brilliant complexion, light hair, blue eyes, a small,
elegant figure, and her manners were very agreeable, with something
of the generation then departing.... Mrs Barbauld is
so well known by her prose writings that it is needless for me
to attempt to characterise her here. Her excellence lay in the
soundness and acuteness of her understanding, and in the perfection
of her taste. In the estimation of Wordsworth she was
the first of our literary women, and he was not bribed to this
judgment by any especial congeniality of feeling or by concurrence
in speculative opinions. I may here relate an anecdote
connecting her and Wordsworth, though out of its proper time
by many, many years; but it is so good that it ought to be preserved
from oblivion. It was after her death that Lucy Aikin
published Mrs Barbauld&rsquo;s collected works, of which I gave a
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
copy to Miss Wordsworth. Among the poems is a Stanza on
Life, written in extreme old age. It had delighted my sister, to
whom I had repeated it on her deathbed. It was long after I
gave these works to Miss Wordsworth that her brother said,
&lsquo;Repeat me that Stanza by Mrs Barbauld.&rsquo; I did so. He
made me repeat it again. And so he learned it by heart. He
was at the time walking in his sitting-room at Rydal with his
hands behind him, and I heard him mutter to himself, &lsquo;I am not
in the habit of grudging people their good things, but I wish I
had written those lines.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s choice fell upon Mary Wilkinson, who was
of about the same age as Anna Letitia Aikin. She was
the daughter of a well-to-do ironmaster at Wrexham,
with whose family he had become acquainted in consequence
of the youngest son, William, having been a
pupil at his school in Nantwich. He certainly had no
reason to regret his choice, whatever Mary Wilkinson
might have felt at times in the &ldquo;cloudy weather&rdquo; she
was destined to go through. It is, of course, idle to
speculate &ldquo;on what might have been if things had
been otherwise.&rdquo; The world, at all events, was the
richer for the <i>Hymns in Prose</i> and the <i>Early
Lessons</i>, on which Mr Rochemont Barbauld&rsquo;s young
charges and many succeeding generations of children
were nurtured.</p>
<p>From a worldly point of view Priestley&rsquo;s marriage
was not without its advantages to him, immediate and
prospective. Mary Wilkinson had all the force of
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
character, and much of the mental and intellectual ability
of her father and her brother John, both of whom had
a considerable share in the development of the iron
industry in this country. Of them Miss Meteyard, in
her <i>Life of Wedgwood</i>, writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;John Wilkinson and his father Isaac played no unimportant
part in the vast industrial movement of their time. Isaac invented
and first brought into action the steam-engine blast at his
iron works near Wrexham. John, at the same place, as also at
Bradley Forge, in Staffordshire, executed all the ponderous
castings for the steam engines required in the Cornish mines,
as well as those for Boulton and Watt when they first commenced
business.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The father was ruined in one of the commercial crises
of which the times were fertile. Of the son we shall
hear more as this history proceeds. He was one of the
truest and staunchest of the many true and staunch
friends Priestley possessed.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Priestley was married in 1762, Mr Threlkeld, one of
the students at the academy, who subsequently became
a well-known Presbyterian divine, notable for his
linguistic attainments and his extraordinary power of
memory, being his groomsman. Whatever might be
Mr Threlkeld&rsquo;s faculty of recollection it went wholly
astray on this occasion, for he became so absorbed in
the study of a Welsh Bible he found beside him in the
pew that he became quite oblivious to the onerous
duties of his office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Of his marriage Priestley characteristically writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This proved a very suitable and happy connection, my wife
being a woman of an excellent understanding, much improved
by reading, of great fortitude and strength of mind, and of a
temper in the highest degree affectionate and generous; feeling
strongly for others, and little for herself. Also, greatly excelling
in everything relating to household affairs, she entirely
relieved me of all concern of that kind, which allowed me to
give all my time to the prosecution of my studies and the other
duties of my station.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All accounts we have of Mary Wilkinson are to the
same effect. Her great-granddaughter, Madame Belloc,
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is a tradition in the family that Mrs Priestley once sent
her famous husband to market with a large basket, and that he
so acquitted himself that she never sent him again! Mrs
Priestley was extremely intelligent and original. Lord
Shelburne once found her sitting on the top of a pair of steps,
clad in a great apron, and vigorously pasting on a new wallpaper.
She received him with calm composure. There is a
good portrait of her as an elderly lady in a cap, curving her hand
round her ear to assist her hearing. She must have herself insisted
upon being painted in this unusual attitude. She looks
like a person of excellent understanding, whose mind has been
much improved by reading.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before he committed himself to matrimony Priestley
took another step hardly less momentous.</p>
<p>What it was may be gleaned from the following
extract of a letter dated May 1, 1762, to Seddon, who
was away at the time on one of his frequent begging
expeditions on behalf of the Academy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am seriously preparing for <i>ordination</i>. As all things in
this world are uncertain, I think it a point of prudence not to
omit anything that may possibly be of advantage to me, if ever
it be my lot to be obliged to have recourse to the ministry for
the whole or any part of my subsistence, particularly as I am
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
going to have a dearer and more important stake in this world
than I have ever yet had in it. I can sincerely say I never
knew what it was to be anxious on my own account, but I
cannot help confessing I begin to feel a good deal on the
account of another person. The hazard of bringing a person
into difficulties which she cannot possibly have any idea or
prospect of affects me, at times, very sensibly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The earliest known portrait of Priestley is of this
period. It represents him as a slender young man with
sloping shoulders, with a keen, intelligent eye and
an expression not unlike that caught by Fuseli at a
later time; his long neck is swathed in the ample folds
of a white neck-cloth, and he wears a full-bottomed
wig.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> During Priestley&rsquo;s residence at Warrington an
artist was employed in making silhouettes of the principal
inhabitants. Many of these were published by Dr
Kendrick in his <i>Profiles of Warrington Worthies</i>. In
that of Priestley the features are delicate and almost
feminine: the full-bottomed wig is very much in
evidence.</p>
<p>Priestley brought his young bride to &ldquo;the good
dwelling-house neatly filled up, handsomely sashed
to the front, with a flight of five steps to the entrance,
three storeys high, four rooms on a floor, cellared
under, with convenient kitchens, yards and out-offices,&rdquo;
over which she was to preside for the next five years.
To add to her responsibilities she was promptly charged
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
with the care of the gay but improvident Mr Ben
Vaughan and his brother Bill, and &ldquo;received the very
moderate compensation of fifty pounds a year for
each son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s house in Academy Street still remains, and
the fact that he occupied it until his removal in 1767 is
commemorated by a bronze tablet affixed to its walls
by the members of the Warrington Society on the
hundredth anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>There is a local tradition that an adjoining building
was used by him as a laboratory, although it is difficult
to find any grounds for the belief. There is no
mention of experimental work at this time in his
memoirs or correspondence, and whatever he might have
done in this direction for his own amusement or the
instruction of his pupils needed no special apartment.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Lectures on chemistry were, however, given at the
academy by Matthew Turner, who is believed to
have first turned Priestley&rsquo;s attention to that science.
Turner, who practised medicine in Liverpool, although
an eccentric man, applied his knowledge of chemistry to
industrial purposes, and he is credited with having
revived the art of glass-painting.</p>
<p>Priestley was now wholly engrossed in the business
of teaching, and although nominally tutor in the classical
languages and in the <i>belles lettres</i>, there was
practically no department of education in which at one
time or other during the half-dozen years of his sojourn
at Warrington he was not called upon, or did not offer,
to instruct. He enlarged and published the <i>Grammar</i>
to which reference has already been made, and began a
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
treatise on &ldquo;The Structure and Contemporary State of
the English Language,&rdquo; the material for which he eventually
gave to Croft of Oxford for the compilation of his
<i>Grammar</i> and <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>
<p>But what particularly impressed him as a practical
educationist was that whilst most of his pupils were
designed for situations in civil and active life, every
article in the plan of their education was adapted to the
learned professions. There was hardly any medium
between an education for the counting-house, consisting
of writing, arithmetic and merchants&rsquo; accounts, and a
method of instruction in the abstract sciences. He proceeds
to trace how this came about:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Formerly none but the clergy were thought to have any
occasion for learning. It was natural, therefore, that the whole
plan of education, from the Grammar School to the finishing at
the University, should be calculated for their use. If a few
other persons, who were not designed for Holy Orders, offered
themselves for education, it could not be expected that a course
of studies should be provided for them only. And, indeed, as
all those persons who superintended the business of education
were of the clerical order, and had themselves been taught
nothing but the rhetoric, logic and school-divinity, or civil
law, which comprised the whole compass of human learning for
several centuries, it could not be expected that they should
entertain larger, or more liberal, views of education; and still
less that they should strike out a course of study for the use of
men who were universally thought to have no need of study,
and of whom few were so sensible of their own wants as to
desire any such advantages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, in those days, the great ends of human society
seem to have been but little understood. Men of the greatest
rank, fortune and influence, and who took the lead in all the
affairs of State, had no idea of the great objects of wise and
extensive policy, and therefore could never apprehend that any
fund of knowledge was requisite for the most eminent stations
in the community. Few persons imagined what were the true
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
sources of wealth, power and happiness in a nation. Commerce
was little understood, or even attended to; and so slight
was the connection of the different nations of Europe that
general politics were very contracted. And thus, men&rsquo;s views
being narrow, little previous furniture of mind was requisite to
conduct them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These paragraphs constitute the introduction to an
<i>Essay on Education</i> which Priestley published in
1764, with the object of drawing attention to the
necessity for a reform in our educational system.
Although written nearly a century and a half ago,
Priestley&rsquo;s main contention that the education of youth
should be directed and adapted to the circumstances
and needs of the time in which they live is just as valid
now as then, and needs the same insistence. He points
out that &ldquo;the severe and proper discipline&rdquo; of the
Grammar Schools, which are subservient to the Universities,
is become a &ldquo;topic of ridicule.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly a call upon us to examine the state of
education in this country, and to consider how those years are
employed which men pass previous to their entering into the
world; for upon this their future behaviour and success
must, in a great measure, depend. A transition, which is not
easy, can never be made with advantage; and therefore it is
certainly our wisdom to contrive that the studies of youth
should tend to fit them for the business of manhood; and that
the objects of their attention, and turn of thinking in younger
life, should not be too remote from the destined employment of
their riper years. If this be not attended to they must
necessarily be mere novices upon entering the great world, be
almost unavoidably embarrassed in their conduct, and, after all
the time and experience bestowed upon their education, be indebted
to a series of blunders for the most useful knowledge
they will ever acquire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man is a friend of his country who observes and endeavours
to supply any defects in the methods of educating
youth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>At the risk of being called &ldquo;a projector, a visionary, or
whatever anybody pleases,&rdquo; he proceeds to show &ldquo;how
to fill up with advantage those years which immediately
precede a young gentleman&rsquo;s engaging in those higher
spheres of active life in which he is destined to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be observed that Priestley is not dealing with
any scheme of national or universal education adapted
to every youth in the community. He is concerned
only with the young man who is destined for a station
in which his conduct may considerably affect the liberty
and the property of his countrymen, and the riches, the
strength and the security of his country; and who is within
the influence of an honourable ambition to appear as a
legislator in the State, or of standing near the helm of
affairs and guiding the secret springs of Government&mdash;in
a word, that class which the universities thought they
alone were specially concerned with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That the parents and friends of young gentlemen destined
to act in any of these important spheres may not think a liberal
education unnecessary to them, and that the young gentlemen
themselves may enter with spirit into the enlarged views of their
friends and tutors, I would humbly propose some new articles
of academical instruction, such as have a nearer and more
evident connection with the business of active life, and which
may therefore bid fairer to engage the attention and rouse the
thinking powers of young gentlemen of an active genius. The
subjects I would recommend are &lsquo;Civil History,&rsquo; and more
especially the important objects of &lsquo;Civil Policy&rsquo;; such as the
theory of laws, government, manufactures, commerce, naval
force, etc., with whatever may be demonstrated from history
to have contributed to the flourishing state of nations, to rendering
a people happy and populous at home and formidable
abroad; together with those articles of previous information,
without which it is impossible to understand the nature, connections
and mutual influences of those great objects.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then gives plans and detailed syllabuses of three
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
distinct courses of lectures subservient to this design.
The first is on the &ldquo;Study of History in General&rdquo;; the
second on the &ldquo;History of England,&rdquo; and the third on the
&ldquo;Present Constitution and Laws of England.&rdquo; This
scheme is so daring an innovation on the established
order of things 150 years ago, that Priestley then proceeds
with care to anticipate, examine and rebut the
objections which may be urged against it. There is no
necessity to dwell upon them now. Much water has
flowed under the Folly Bridge or past the &ldquo;Backs&rdquo;
since Priestley&rsquo;s essay was penned, and everything for
which he contended, and even more, now finds its proper
place in the educational schemes of all our universities,
ancient and modern. But it is significant of the condition
of things in the older seats of learning in the
middle of the eighteenth century, that he should have
to urge his project apologetically and to labour
points which to-day appear almost axiomatic. The
essay is characteristic of the author in the breadth and
liberality of its tone, in its declaration of the real
functions and objects of government, and in its note of
true patriotism. Of course it was fiercely attacked,
among others, by Griffiths in the <i>Monthly Review</i>, but
it enlisted Josiah Wedgwood&rsquo;s sympathy with its author
and formed the basis of a friendship as cordial and
enduring as it was useful.</p>
<p>The lectures on &ldquo;History&rdquo; and on &ldquo;General Policy&rdquo;
were subsequently published, with a dedication, as
already stated, to Mr Benjamin Vaughan. It is interesting
at this juncture to learn the views Priestley
inculcated on the youth of Warrington concerning other
matters which, like the education problem and the poor,
are always with us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>In the 51st lecture on &ldquo;General Policy&rdquo; we read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The gain of the merchants, it is said, is not always the gain
of the country in general. If, for instance, a merchant imports
foreign goods by which the consumption of national manufactures
is hurt, though the merchant should be gainer by those
goods, the State is a loser. As, on the other hand, a merchant
may export the manufactures of his own country to his own
loss and the nation&rsquo;s gain. But if the merchants be gainers, the
consumers, that is those for whose use manufactures are established,
having a power of purchasing or not at pleasure, must be
so too. And if, after sufficient trial, it be found that merchants
importing foreign goods can sell these cheaper than the manufactures
can be bought at home, it is an indication that it is not for the
interest of the nation at large to encourage such manufactures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though exportation makes a nation rich, we are not to
judge of the quantity of riches which a nation gains by trade
from exportation only, but the importation must also be considered.
If these exactly balance one another nothing can be
said to be gained or lost, just as a person is not the richer for
selling a quantity of goods if he buy to the same amount.
Nay, though the exportation be lessened, if the importation be
lessened more than in proportion, it proves an increase of
gainful trade, notwithstanding the decrease of exportation.
This, however, is estimating the value of commerce by the
mere increase of money. But a nation may flourish by internal
commerce only, and what is <i>external</i> commerce between
two nations not united in government would be internal if
they should come under the same government. In every fair
bargain the buyer and the seller are equally gainers, whether
money be accumulated by either of the parties or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great mistake to confound the king&rsquo;s revenue with
the gain a nation makes by its trade. No man would presume
to say it is more for the public benefit that the nation should
expend a million or more every year with foreigners, in order
to raise a hundred thousand pounds to the revenue by the
customs, than to save that million or more within ourselves
and to raise only the hundred thousand pounds the other way.
But Ministers of State are apt to estimate the value of everything
to the country by the gain it brings, and that immediately
to themselves....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;The legislature of any country has seldom interfered in
the affairs of commerce, but commerce has suffered in consequence
to it, owing to the ignorance of statesmen, and even of
merchants themselves, concerning the nature of trade. And
indeed the principles of commerce are very complicated and
require long experience and deep reflection before they can be
well understood....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most politicians have injured commerce by restricting,
confining or burthening it too much; the consequence of which
has been that by aiming at great immediate advantage they
have cut off the very springs of all future advantage. The
inconveniences which have arisen to a nation from leaving trade
quite open are few, and very problematical in comparison of
the manifest injury it receives from being cramped in almost
any form whatsoever....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Colbert, a man of great probity, knowledge and industry
... would have done better to have listened to the
advice of an old merchant, who being consulted by him about
what he should do in favour of trade, said, &lsquo;<i>Laissez nous faire</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another place he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The happiness of all nations, therefore, as one great community,
will be best promoted by laying aside all national
<i>jealousy of trade</i>, and by each country cultivating those productions
or manufactures which they can do to the most advantage;
and experience, in a state of perfect liberty, will
soon teach them what those are. In this state of things the
only advantage will be on the side of industry and ingenuity,
and no man or nation ought to wish it to be anywhere
else.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With regard to questions of political and civil liberty,
the theory of the progress of law, the influence of
religion on civil society, the connection of modes of
religion with forms of government, the teaching is
precisely what we should expect in such a hot-bed of
liberal dissent as the Warrington Academy. With
regard to the connection between civil government and
religion he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;The principal sufferer by this alliance between the Church
and the State is religion itself, that is, the members of
society as professors of religion and deriving advantages from
it. For when it is thus guarded by the State, if it be faulty
or wants reformation, it must long continue so. The professors
of it, being interested in its support, will do everything
in their power to prevent any alteration, though it should be
ever so much wanted....</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is alleged, in favour of these establishments, that religion
has an influence on the conduct of men in this life. No doubt
it has, as it connects the hopes of a future life with good
behaviour in this. But this is done in all sects of Christians,
and as much in those which are reprobated by the State as
those which are encouraged by it. Besides, if this was the
true cause of attachment to Christian establishments, the
friends of them would be much more jealous of unbelievers
than they are of sectaries, which does not appear to be the
case.... One would think that Christian Governments
might content themselves with establishing the Christian
religion in general without confining themselves to any particular
mode of it. But so far is this from being the case,
that by the present laws of this country a man who denies the
doctrine of the Trinity, which has no more imaginable connection
with the good of the State than the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
is deemed a blasphemer and sentenced to suffer
confiscation of goods and imprisonment....</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all other countries the established religion is that of
the majority of the people, and the writers in defence of it
vindicate it on this principle, viz., that it is the religion of the
majority, whatever that be. But in Ireland we have a most
remarkable exception to this rule. There the established
religion is not that of the majority but of a small minority of
the people, perhaps not more than that of one in ten of the inhabitants.
That so flagrant an abuse of power should exist,
and under a Government pretending to justice, and even to
liberality, is barely credible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here again much water has flowed under the bridges
since these words were penned, but the bread which
Priestley cast upon the stream, as well as that upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
which he nurtured the young gentlemen of the
Warrington Academy, has, we recognise, not been
wholly wasted. In regard to what he considered other
anomalies, the State still takes upon itself a &ldquo;great,
dangerous and unnecessary burthen&rdquo; by undertaking the
care of religion. From the remains of superstition
the clergy are still considered as a distinct order of men
in this country, and they are in a manner represented in
Parliament by the bishops having seats in the House of
Lords. &ldquo;From which,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;if they had a just
sense of the nature of their office, and consulted their
true dignity, they would retire of their own accord.
At present their seat in the House only flatters their
pride and gives the minister so many votes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In regard to other items of political and social
development, it is noteworthy that Priestley was a
consistent opponent of national education as we understand
it to-day, on the ground that in his judgment it
was inimical to liberty and the natural rights of parents.
His position, in fact, was very similar to that taken up
by a considerable and influential section of Liberal
Dissenters prior to 1870.</p>
<p>Whilst at Warrington he also gave lectures on the
&ldquo;Theory of Language,&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Laws and Constitutions
of England,&rdquo; and on &ldquo;Oratory and Criticism&rdquo;&mdash;all of
which were subsequently published, and which may still
be read with profit, despite Lord Brougham&rsquo;s sneering
allusion to the adventurous tutor afflicted with an
incurable stutter who, having never heard any speaking
save in the pulpits of meeting-houses, promulgated rules
of eloquence and of jurisprudence to the senators and
lawyers of his country. The adventurous tutor with
the incurable stutter even taught Elocution, also Logic
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
and Hebrew for a time, and one year he gave a course
of lectures on Anatomy.</p>
<p>Whilst at Warrington he published a <i>Chart of
Biography</i>, exhibiting by lines and spaces the succession
of the eminent men in every age and of every
profession, with the relative length of their lives, and in
such manner that at any given epoch it could be seen
not only who flourished in it, but how all their ages
stood with respect to one another, who were a man&rsquo;s
contemporaries, how far any of them was before him,
or how far after him, in the order of their births or
deaths.</p>
<p>The <i>Chart of Biography</i> procured for its compiler
the degree of Doctor of Laws of the University of
Edinburgh.</p>
<p>It has been said of Priestley that he was not a man
who made friends. If it is meant by this that he was
essentially a self-centred recluse, who sought his relaxation
in change of occupation, or only within his own
family circle, the statement gives a wholly imperfect
idea of the man and is very wide of the truth.</p>
<p>In reality he was one of the most gregarious and
most easily approachable of individuals, a man of strong,
active human sympathies and of much social charm.
There is abundant evidence of this in the testimony of
his contemporaries; it is illustrated by numberless
anecdotes, and is reflected in almost every letter of his
correspondence.</p>
<p>It was, doubtless, under the impulse of the social
instincts of his nature that, whilst at Warrington, he
was led to begin the practice of spending one month in
every year in London. This, remarks his son, was of
great use to him. He saw and heard a great deal. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
new turn was frequently given to his ideas. New and
useful acquaintances were formed, and old ones confirmed.
London then, as now, was the centre of the
intellectual life of the kingdom and the Royal Society
the seat of its scientific activity. To a man of
Priestley&rsquo;s versatility and eagerness, whose curiosity
ranged practically over every department of human
knowledge, these annual visits were a sort of intellectual
tonic and gave a powerful stimulus to his
activity.</p>
<p>On the first of them he made the acquaintance of
men who, in their several capacities, proved to be true
and valuable friends, notably, Dr Richard Price, Mr
Canton, and Dr Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>Dr Price, a philosopher, and an eminent nonconformist
divine, and one of the leading Arians of his
time, is best known by his work on morals, and by his
writings on financial and political questions. Among
these, his papers in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> on
&ldquo;Life Insurance&rdquo; and on the &ldquo;Proper Method of Calculating
the Values of Contingent Reversions,&rdquo; are specially
noteworthy. His pamphlet on the National Debt is said
to have influenced Pitt in establishing the Sinking Fund
for its extinction, and that on the &ldquo;Policy of the War
with America&rdquo; to have contributed to the declaration
of independence by the Americans. His liberal opinions
gained him the friendship and patronage of Lord
Shelburne. The acquaintance with Priestley soon
ripened into a lasting friendship, which was in nowise
disturbed by the controversy on materialism and
necessity in which they subsequently engaged. Price
and Priestley held similar views as to the French
Revolution, and both were denounced with equal
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
fierceness by Burke. Price died in the spring of 1791,
and his funeral sermon was preached by Priestley, who
succeeded him in the care of the Gravel Pit Meeting at
Hackney. He was a man for whom Priestley ever
entertained the warmest feelings of friendship on the
ground of his amiable simplicity, his truly Christian
spirit, disinterested patriotism and true candour.</p>
<p>John Canton, a notable schoolmaster in his day, is
best known for his electrical inquiries and for his work
on the compressibility of water, and his name is
associated with the phosphorescent substance first obtained
by him by calcining oyster shells with flowers of
sulphur.</p>
<p>Among the Canton papers in the possession of the
Royal Society is a letter from Seddon to Canton introducing
Priestley, in which the latter is described as the
author of <i>A Chart of Biography</i> and of an <i>Essay on Education</i>,
and in which the writer says of the bearer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You will find him a benevolent, sensible man, with a considerable
share of learning. Besides the studies which belong
to his profession, he has a taste for Natural Philosophy which
will not render him less agreeable to you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Priestley greatly enjoyed and profited by his
Christmas in London is evident from the terms in which
he refers to it in a letter to Canton under date February
14, 1766.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The time I had the happiness to spend in your company
appears upon revision like a pleasing dream. I frequently enjoy
it once again in recollection, and ardently wish for a repetition
of it. I wish, but in vain, that it may ever be in my power to
return in kind your generous communication of philosophical
intelligence and discoveries.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He concludes the letter by expressing a desire to
become a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Benjamin Franklin, journeyman printer and journalist,
statesman and diplomatist, was about sixty years old when
Priestley, then a man of little more than half his age,
first made his personal acquaintance. The Royal
Society, which had formerly ridiculed the discoveries
which have given Franklin his undisputed position as
one of the most eminent natural philosophers of his time,
had paid him, although still a British subject, the distinguished
compliment of making him an honorary
fellow. At the time of Priestley&rsquo;s coming to town he
was occupied with the great struggle on behalf of the
American Colony which ended in the defeat of the
Stamp Act, and his famous examination before a
Committee of Parliament had made him an object
of great popular interest. During the eight or nine
succeeding years in which Franklin remained in England
his acquaintance with Priestley grew into the closest
friendship, and there can be no question that the friendship
reacted powerfully on Priestley&rsquo;s work as a political
thinker and as a natural philosopher. Indeed, it may be
truthfully said that Franklin made Priestley into a man
of science.</p>
<p>As the result of this intercourse with Canton and
Franklin, Priestley offered to compile what he called
&ldquo;a distinct and methodical account&rdquo; of the history of
discoveries in electricity, provided he could be supplied
with the necessary books. Franklin warmly seconded
the proposal, and undertook, with the assistance of
friends, to furnish all existing literature on the subject.
As a matter of fact almost the whole of the historical
account in Priestley&rsquo;s book is taken from the <i>Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society</i>, which was then
the chief source of information concerning electrical
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
science, inasmuch as the English electricians of that
period, in addition to their own original papers, which
were both numerous and important, introduced into the
<i>Transactions</i> detailed accounts of all the principal books
on electricity published abroad. In putting together
his work, Priestley, having, as he says, a pretty good
machine, was led to endeavour to ascertain several facts
which were in dispute, and was thus led by degrees
into a large field of experimental inquiry, in which he
spared no expense that he could possibly afford. One
of the most important of his discoveries is that charcoal
is a good conductor. He describes coloured circles
produced by receiving discharges from 21 square feet of
glass on metal plates. When an electrical battery is
discharged light bodies placed near the electric circuit
are moved. Priestley ascribes this motion to what he
calls the force of the lateral explosion, and he conceives
it to depend upon the sudden elasticity given to the air.
He found that a long circuit conducts much worse than
a short circuit, even when the conductors are the same;
also, that when the circuit contains an imperfect conductor
a spark passes to bodies near, no electricity being communicated.</p>
<p>The work necessitated much correspondence with
Franklin and others of his philosophical friends in
London, and much of his leisure was devoted to his
own experimental observations. Nevertheless, the book
was completed in less than a year. Hasty and imperfect
as it was, &ldquo;<i>The History and Present State of Electricity</i>.
With Original Experiments, illustrated with Copperplates,&rdquo;
was well received and ran through five editions
in its author&rsquo;s lifetime. Its publication at once stamped
Priestley as a man of science; it secured him recognition
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
as such in scientific circles at home and abroad, and
was the immediate cause of his election, on June 12,
1766, into the Royal Society. The growing interest
in the subject induced him to put together a <i>Familiar
Introduction to the Study of Electricity</i>, which had also a
considerable measure of success and was the means of
popularising a knowledge of the main facts then known
concerning Frictional Electricity. Priestley was instrumental
in reviving the use of large electrical machines
and batteries. The first of the large machines for
which Nairne became famous was constructed in consequence
of a request made to Priestley by the Grand
Duke of Tuscany to procure for him the best machine
that could be made in England. One of his machines,
which figured in his <i>History</i>, and also in his <i>Familiar
Introduction</i>, is in the possession of the Royal Society.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Although Priestley lived in philosophic contentment
with his lot at Warrington, happy in his occupations
and in the society of congenial colleagues, the circumstances
of the Academy were not fortunate. The
institution never wholly recovered from the unhappy
differences between the trustees and the first head of
the Educational Staff, and in time many of the subscribers
grew lukewarm in their support. Priestley
had a remarkable power of adapting himself to his
environment; he was one of the most even-tempered of
men and had a capacity for being cheerful that would
have extorted admiration even from Socrates. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
says Miss Aiken, &ldquo;the Alma Mater of Warrington was
ever a niggardly recompense of the distinguished abilities
and virtues which were enlisted in her service.&rdquo; One
hundred pounds a year, with a house and a few boarders&mdash;hungry
lads at &pound;15 a year, exclusive of washing and
candles&mdash;meant little towards the <i>res angusta domi</i>.
Moreover, little Sarah Priestley had made her appearance,
and the uncertain prospects which were before
that young lady, coupled with the condition of her
mother&rsquo;s health, which was not wholly satisfactory at
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
Warrington, led him to contemplate the expediency of
giving up school-mastering and of resuming his profession
of the ministry. Accordingly he was induced
to accept an invitation to take charge of the congregation
of Mill Hill Chapel, at Leeds, where he was already
pretty well known, and thither he removed in 1767.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Although it was no part of his duty to preach when
at Warrington, he had from choice continued the
practice, and wishing to maintain the character of a
Dissenting minister, he had, as we have already seen,
been ordained whilst there. His tendency to stammer
was still a difficulty. Indeed, whilst at Nantwich it was
so marked that he had almost resolved to abandon the
calling. By reading aloud and very slowly every day,
and by taking pains, he in some measure got the better
of his defect, but he never wholly overcame it.</p>
<p>At Leeds he found a liberal, friendly and harmonious
congregation, to whom his services, of which he was not
sparing, were very acceptable. There, he says, he had
no unreasonable prejudices to contend with, so that he
had full scope for every kind of exertion. His activity
and zeal in the special duties of his office led him to
prepare and print catechisms for the young and to form
various classes of catechumens and to instruct them in the
principles of religion. He also published discourses on
&ldquo;Family Prayer,&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Supper&rdquo; and on &ldquo;Church
Discipline,&rdquo; some of which were not altogether to the
liking of members of the Established Church. Indeed,
the first of his controversial pieces was written in
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
answer to some angry remarks on one of these discourses
written by a clergyman in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>His return to the active duties of the ministry naturally
induced him to resume the studies in Speculative Theology
which had occupied him at Needham but which had
been in large measure interrupted by the business of teaching
at Nantwich and Warrington. He now published his
<i>Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion</i>, and began the
publication of <i>The Theological Repository</i>, a collection of
papers on theological questions, contributed by himself
and a number of neighbouring ministers and others.
The work eventually extended to six volumes, three
of which were printed whilst he was at Leeds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Theological Repository</i>,&rdquo; says the Rev. Charles Wicksteed,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>
&ldquo;was one of those publications which will always appear
from time to time in every body in which there is much
activity and much freedom of thought. It had, however, a
very slender circulation, and was very little read by any but
theologians of the Liberal school. Indeed, it discussed questions
which were viewed with terror by many even of the Liberal
school itself, because it, in fact, purposely deserted the beaten
track of opinion and opened out those questions on which difficulties
began to be felt, or on which fresh light was wanted.
It aimed at collecting the contributions of free, independent
and thoughtful minds&mdash;<i>towards</i> correct ultimate decisions,
without pretending itself to furnish those decisions. This is
ever a position which the bigoted violently resent, which the
unlearned cannot understand, on which even the candid and
liberal often look with a dissatisfaction not unmingled with fear,
but which is, notwithstanding, the essential preliminary of
correct settled opinion in every age of thought. It is a
position often assumed by the most contemplative and the
most thoroughly honest men of the generation, but one which
is never understood until the generation which produced and
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
neglected it is passed. If there were not this neutral ground
on which inquiring spirits can meet, beyond the hackneyed and
settled points in which alone the many are interested, there
would be an end to thought, which in a short time would prove
an end to active, healthy, influential and tested truth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly after his removal to Leeds, Priestley avowed
himself an adherent to that school of theological opinion
which its enemies associate with the name of Fausto
Sozzini; that is, he became what has been called a
<i>humanitarian</i>, or a believer in the doctrine that Jesus
Christ was in nature solely and truly a man, however
highly exalted by God.</p>
<p>Sozzini&rsquo;s doctrine brought down upon its teacher the
ill-will of a Cracow mob; his house was wrecked, his
books and manuscripts destroyed, his life threatened,
and he was driven from the city. Two hundred years
later the Socinian Priestley went through precisely the
same experience. Wrecking the homes, pillaging the
property and injuring the persons of heresiarchs might
seem an extraordinary way of identifying oneself with
the doctrine of the gentle author of the Sermon on the
Mount if history had not made us pretty familiar with
such spectacles. At Leeds, as already stated, Priestley
published the first of the series of controversial pieces
on religion and politics which ceased only with his
death. By some strange irony of fate this man, who
was by nature one of the most peaceable and peace-loving
of men, singularly calm and dispassionate, not
prone to disputation or given to wrangling, acquired
the reputation of being perhaps the most cantankerous
man of his time, who delighted in tilting against
established usage, and whose hand, Ishmael-like, was
against every man&rsquo;s. By sheer force of circumstances
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
he became an indefatigable pamphleteer, apparently ever
ready to vindicate the cause of civil and religious liberty,
to champion the principles and conduct of Dissenters,
and to attack what he considered the inveterate prejudices
of the prevailing religion of his countrymen.</p>
<p>As a controversialist his methods were beyond reproach,
and the arts of casuistry were wholly foreign
to his character. He was so obviously sincere and
fair-minded that he frequently overcame prejudice and
disarmed criticism by his unconscious unwritten appeal
to the finer instincts of his adversaries. He made many
enemies but he won far more friends: the enemies were
for the most part men whom history willingly lets die;
the friends were of every sect, and some of them were
among the chief glories of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The following characteristic letter to his friend, Miss
Aiken, is interesting as illustrating the action of the
active, eager mind which, as its owner says, found scope
for every kind of exertion at this period of his life:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Leeds</span>, <i>13th June 1769</i>.</span></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Miss Aikin</span>,&mdash;You will be surprised when I tell you
I write this on the behalf of <i>Pascal Paoli</i> and the brave <i>Corsicans</i>,
but it is strictly true. Mr Turner of Wakefield, who
says he reads your poems, not with admiration, but astonishment,
insists upon my writing to you to request that a copy of
your poem, called <i>Corsica</i>, may be sent to Mr Boswell, with
permission to publish it for the benefit of those noble islanders.
He is confident that it cannot fail greatly to promote their
interest, now that a subscription is open for them, by raising
a generous ardour in the cause of liberty and admiration of
their glorious struggle in its defence. Its being written <i>by a
lady</i>, he thinks, will be a circumstance very much in their
favour and that of the poem, but there is no occasion for Mr
Boswell to be acquainted with your name unless it be your own
choice some time hence. I own I entirely agree with Mr
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
Turner in these sentiments, and therefore hope Miss Aikin
will not refuse so reasonable a request, which will, at the same
time, lay a great obligation on her friends in England and
contribute to the relief of her own heroes in Corsica. Consider
that you are as much a general as Tyrt&aelig;us was, and your
poems (which, I am confident, are much better than his ever
were) may have as great an effect as his. They may be the
<i>coup de grace</i> to the French troops in that island, and Paoli,
who reads English, will cause it to be printed in every history
of that renowned island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without any joke, I wish you would comply with this
request. In this case you have only to send a corrected copy
to me at Leeds, to Mr Johnson in London, and I will take
care to introduce it to the notice of Mr Boswell by means
of Mr Vaughan or Mrs Macauley, or some other of the friends
of liberty and Corsica in London. The sooner this is done
the better. Mr Turner regrets very much that it was not
done some time ago. I shall not tell you what I think of your
poems for more than twenty reasons, one of which is that I am
not able to express it. We are now all expectation at the
opening of every packet from Warrington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My piece on Perspective is nearly ready for the press. Come
and see us before it is quite printed, and I will engage to teach
you the whole art and mystery of it in a few hours. If you
come a month after I may know no more about the matter than
anybody else. I am about to make a bolder push than ever for
the <i>pillory</i>, the <i>King&rsquo;s Bench Prison</i>, or something worse. Tell
Mr Aikin he may hug himself that I have no connection with
the Academy. On Monday next Mr Turner and I set out on
a visit to the Archdeacon at Richmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all our compliments to all your worthy family, I am,
with the greatest cordiality, your friend and admirer,</p>
<p><span class="lr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">J. Priestley</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pasquale de Paoli, the Corsican patriot, whose
struggles to secure the independence of his native island
had excited warm sympathy in England and had enlisted
the pen of Boswell, was at that time a refugee in this
country, having been defeated, after a stubborn resistance,
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
by the French under Count Vaux. The poem on
&ldquo;Corsica,&rdquo; one of the earliest and most beautiful of Miss
Aikin&rsquo;s productions, was written in 1768, at about the
period of the appearance of Boswell&rsquo;s <i>Account of Corsica</i>,
but it was first published in 1773 in a collection of her
poems, of which four editions, the first in 4to, the
three others in 8vo were printed in that year.</p>
<p>The copy seen by Priestley was in manuscript.
Whether it was shown to Boswell or to Paoli is not
recorded.</p>
<p>The piece on Perspective was published in 1770,
under the title of &ldquo;<i>A Familiar Introduction to the
Theory and Practice of Perspective</i>. With copperplates.&rdquo;
He gave as his reason for writing it that, having occasion
to make drawings of philosophical instruments and
apparatus he had felt the need of a work treating of
perspective. It will be seen in the various editions of
his works that the words &ldquo;Priestley del&rdquo; are engraved
at the left-hand corner of the copperplates of the
illustrations. The book had a considerable sale and
was frequently recommended by drawing-masters. A
second edition appeared in 1782 and it continued to be
used well into the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the first printed account
of the use of india-rubber for the purpose of erasing
lead pencil marks occurs in the preface to this work.
It ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Since this work was printed off I have seen a substance
excellently adapted to the purpose of wiping off from paper the
marks of black lead pencil. It must therefore be of singular
use to those who practise drawing. It is sold by Mr Nairne,
mathematical instrument maker, opposite the Royal Exchange.
He sells a cubical piece of about half an inch for three shillings,
and he says it will last several years.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The &ldquo;bolder push than ever for the <i>pillory</i>, the <i>King&rsquo;s
Bench Prison</i>, or something worse,&rdquo; probably refers to the
anonymous pieces which he published in support of
&ldquo;Wilkes and Liberty&rdquo; in the course of the memorable
struggle between the freeholders of Middlesex and the
House of Commons concerning the rights of free representation
by parliamentary constituencies which at that
time agitated the country. Wilkes had shortly before the
date of this letter been fined by the King&rsquo;s Bench &pound;1000
and sentenced to twenty-two months&rsquo; imprisonment
for publishing an impious libel, and had been expelled
from the House of Commons&mdash;to which, however, he
was repeatedly returned by the electors of Middlesex.</p>
<p>The Richmond visit to Archdeacon Blackburne, whose
son had been at the Warrington Academy, is memorable
from the circumstance that on its occasion Priestley first
met Theophilus Lindsey, with whom he contracted an
intimate and lasting friendship, which greatly influenced
the lives and fortunes of both, and of which Priestley
subsequently wrote that it had been a source of more
real satisfaction to him than any other circumstance in
his whole life.</p>
<p>The busy pamphleteer found time, however, to put
together more ambitious works than <i>Wilkes and Liberty</i>.
The success of his <i>History of Electricity</i> induced him to
attempt the compilation of the history of all the
branches of experimental philosophy, and he made
proposals to publish a <i>History of Discoveries Relating to
Vision Light and Colours</i>. The subscription to this work
was not, however, sufficient to induce him to proceed,
and after a considerable outlay in the purchase of books
and other material the project was abandoned.</p>
<p>Priestley was, perhaps, the most industrious bookmaker
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
of his age. Boswell indeed dubbed him a
&ldquo;literary Jack-of-all-Trades,&rdquo; and he was busy with
proof-sheets even to the day of his death. In fact, the
closing act of his life, before he put his hand to his face
to hide the last flicker of the vital spark, was to make a
correction in a proof-sheet. He usually composed in
shorthand, and much of this work was done in the
family circle, sitting by the parlour fire. Conversation
never disturbed him. Although his style is somewhat
prolix, his language is simple and direct and his meaning
invariably clear. Charges that his writings were
hasty performances in nowise disturbed him. Indeed,
he was wont to say that some of those that were most
hurriedly done were among those that were best received.
Whatever might have been the time he spent on their
composition he was confident that more would not have
contributed to their perfection in any essential particular,
and about anything farther he was never very solicitous.
His object, he said, was not to acquire the character of
a fine writer but of a useful one. Pecuniary gain was
never the chief object of his work; several of his
books, indeed, were written with the prospect of certain
loss. Many writers before and since the great lexicographer
have left us what they have imagined to have
been the secret of their success as literary craftsmen, and
have told us of the means by which they gained their proficiency
of composition and mastery of style. Priestley
has no pretensions to be considered a master of style;
nevertheless, it is of interest to learn how he acquired
facility in writing the simple, unaffected English
which characterises his literary work. It came, he
said, from a practice of committing to writing as much
as he could of the sermons he heard, and of composing
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
much in verse. With regard to the sermons,
he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This practice I began very early, and continued it until I
was able from the heads of a discourse to supply the rest
myself. For, not troubling myself to commit to memory much
of the amplification, and writing at home almost as much as I
had heard, I insensibly acquired a habit of composing with
great readiness, and from this practice I believe I have derived
great advantage through life, composition seldom employing so
much time as would be necessary to write in long hand anything
I have published.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As regards the verses, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I was myself far from having any pretension to the
character of a poet, but in the early part of my life I was a
great versifier, and this, I believe, as well as my custom of
writing after preachers, mentioned before, contributed to the
ease with which I always wrote prose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Priestley was not himself a poet, he was at least the
cause of poetry in another. Miss Aikin once told him
that it was the perusal of some verses of his that first
induced her fledgling muse to soar&mdash;so that, he adds,
&ldquo;this country is in some measure indebted to me for
one of the best poets it can boast of.&rdquo; No example of
Priestley&rsquo;s abilities as a &ldquo;versifier&rdquo; has come down to
us, but in that dainty little sketch of the Warrington
society, by Miss Lucy Aikin, from which we have
already quoted, allusion is made to his accomplishment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Both <i>bouts rim&eacute;s</i> and <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i> were in fashion with
the set. Once it was their custom to slip anonymous pieces
into Mrs Priestley&rsquo;s work-bag. One &lsquo;copy of verses,&rsquo; a very
eloquent one, puzzled all guessers a long time; at length it was
traced to Dr Priestley&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the man of science the special interest of Priestley&rsquo;s
connection with Leeds arises from the fact that he began
there that fruitful series of inquiries, relating to what
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
he called &ldquo;the doctrine of air,&rdquo; which eventually raised
him to the position of one of the greatest chemical discoverers
of his time. The house in which he first lived
whilst at Leeds was in Meadow Lane and adjoined the
public brew house of Jakes and Nell. He was thereby
led, in the outset, to amuse himself by making experiments
on the &ldquo;fixed air,&rdquo; or carbonic acid, which is
largely produced in the process of fermentation. When
he removed to his second house in Basinghall Street, on
the site where the schools now stand, he was under the
necessity of making the fixed air for himself; and, as he
distinctly and faithfully notes in his various publications
on the subject, he was led to make one experiment after
another until he became, what he does not state, the
greatest master of pneumatic chemistry of his age.</p>
<p>When he began these experiments he tells us he
knew very little of chemistry. Indeed, he says he had
in a manner no idea on the subject before his attention
was drawn to it in a course of lectures delivered in the
Warrington Academy by Dr Turner of Liverpool.
But, as he says, on the whole, this circumstance was no
disadvantage to him, as in the situation in which he
found himself he was led to devise an apparatus and
processes of his own adapted to his peculiar views. If
he had been previously accustomed to the usual chemical
processes he might not have so easily thought of any
other; and without new modes of operation he thinks
he should hardly have discovered anything materially
new. His means did not permit him to purchase
expensive apparatus. Indeed, this very circumstance
materially contributed to his success by making his
apparatus so simple that his experiments could be
readily repeated and their accuracy thereby ensured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>His first contribution to Pneumatic Chemistry was
published in 1772. It was a small pamphlet on a
method of impregnating water with fixed air, which,
being immediately translated into French, excited a
great degree of attention to the subject, and this was
much increased by the publication of his first experimental
paper in the <i>Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society</i>.</p>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s earliest method of impregnating water
with carbonic acid consisted in exposing it to the gas
above the surface of fermenting wort. This process
was no doubt accompanied with many disadvantages and
the resulting solution could not have been very palatable.
Later on he adopted the method originally
employed by Lane in 1709, although apparently in
ignorance of Lane&rsquo;s paper in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
of making the gas from chalk and sulphuric acid
and leading it directly into the water by means of a
flexible tube provided with an intercepting bladder to
retain any solid or acid substance projected from the
effervescent materials in the generating flask. At
about this period increased attention was being paid
to the question of the supply of drinking water in the
Navy, owing to the publication of Irving&rsquo;s plan of
making fresh water from sea-water by distillation, and
Priestley conceived the idea that if some ready means
could be devised of impregnating water with carbonic
acid on shipboard the solution might be useful as a
preventive of sea scurvy.</p>
<p>Priestley brought his idea to the knowledge of the
Duke of Northumberland, and showed a sample of the
impregnated water to Sir George Savile, who introduced
him to Lord Sandwich, at that time First Lord of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
Admiralty in Lord North&rsquo;s Administration. The Board of
Admiralty thought the matter was of sufficient importance
to ask for a report from the College of Physicians,
and Priestley was requested to appear before that body
in order to explain and illustrate his process. The
report from the College was favourable, and in consequence
two war-ships were fitted with the apparatus.</p>
<p>The idea that scurvy, in common with other so-called
putrid diseases, was due to an insufficient supply
of &ldquo;fixed air&rdquo; in the animal economy, and that it might be
cured by the administration of that gas, originated with
Dr Macbride about the middle of the eighteenth
century, shortly after Black had established the individuality
of the gas, and it was current doctrine with
the faculty at the time of Priestley&rsquo;s experiments. The
reasons which Macbride gave in support of his hypothesis
are contained in his <i>Essays on Medical and Philosophical
Subjects</i>, and are sufficiently ingenious to be worth stating
as characteristic of much of the therapeutics of the
time. Macbride assumed that substances held together,
and acquired the quality of firmness, by virtue of containing
a &ldquo;cementing principle,&rdquo; which ensured the
perfect cohesion of their constituent particles, and that
as putrefaction resulted in the decomposition and disintegration
of substances, putridity was connected with
the loss or disappearance of this cementing or cohering
principle. He found that &ldquo;fixed air&rdquo; was invariably
produced when animal and vegetable substances putrefy,
that a greater amount of fixed air is produced from
vegetable substances than from animal substances, and
that animal and vegetable matters putrefy more rapidly
when mixed than when separate, and yield more fixed
air in conjunction than apart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>On the basis of these observations Macbride proceeded
to explain the well-established fact that a diet mainly
composed of animal food is apt to produce sea scurvy,
the remedy for which is a sufficient supply of fresh
vegetables, by assuming that the virtue of the vegetables
was due to the evolution of a greater amount of carbonic
acid in the process of digestion, the fixed air so liberated
in the body counteracting, by its antiseptic powers,
putridity in the circulating fluids.</p>
<p>We are not here concerned with the subsequent
history of so-called &aelig;rated or soda-water, as it came
to be called, but it is worth noting that Priestley&rsquo;s
account of his process contains one remark which is not
without significance in view of latter-day developments.
He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt but that, by the help of a condensing engine,
water might be much more highly impregnated with the virtues
of the Pyrmont spring, and it would not be difficult to contrive
a method of doing it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The manufacture of these waters was subsequently
taken up by Priestley&rsquo;s friend and <i>satellite</i>, as he called
himself, Richard Bewley, of Great Massingham, an
apothecary, and the inventor of the well-known
&ldquo;mephitic julep.&rdquo; Bewley appears to have discovered
that the addition of a small quantity of carbonate of soda
to the water enabled it to absorb and retain an increased
quantity of carbonic acid, and to him, therefore, is due
the credit of first making what was long called
&ldquo;acidulous soda-water.&rdquo; The receipt for its manufacture
and use, given by Henry of Manchester, is
sufficiently quaint to be worth reproduction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To prepare Mr Bewley&rsquo;s julep dissolve three drachms of
fossil alkali in each quart of water, and throw in streams of
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
fixed air till the alkaline taste be destroyed. This julep should
not be prepared in too large quantities, and should be kept in
bottles very closely corked and sealed. Four ounces of it may
be taken at a time, drinking a draught of lemonade or water
acidulated with vinegar or weak spirit of vitriol, by which means
the fixed air will be extricated in the stomach.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hardly to be supposed that the Royal Society
Club in 1773 adopted all the social manners and customs
of the period. Nevertheless, its members, who were
among the most influential fellows of the Society, were
evidently greatly impressed with the merits of Priestley&rsquo;s
soda-water, since the Council of the Society were moved
to reward its discoverer with the Copley Medal.</p>
<p>In making the award on St Andrew&rsquo;s Day 1773, Sir
John Pringle, then President of the Royal Society,
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For having learned from Dr Black that this fixed or mephitic
air could in great abundance be procured from chalk by means
of diluted spirits of vitriol; from Dr Macbride that this fluid
was of a considerable antiseptic nature; from Dr Cavendish
that it could in a large quantity be absorbed by water; and
from Dr Brownrigg that it was this very air which gave the
briskness and chief virtues to the Spa and Pyrmont waters;
Dr Priestley, I say, so well instructed, conceived that common
water impregnated with this fluid alone might be useful in
medicine, particularly for sailors on long voyages, for curing or
preventing the sea scurvy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To-day the Copley Medal is regarded as the highest
award which it is in the power of the Society to bestow,
and certainly no man starts his scientific career by
acquiring it&mdash;not even for so signal an invention as that
of soda-water.</p>
<p>Whilst Priestley was at Leeds a proposal was made
to him that he should accompany Captain Cook in his
second voyage to the South Seas. It probably arose
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
from his connection with the Admiralty in the matter of
his invention. He tells us that as the terms were very
advantageous he consented to it, the heads of his congregation
agreeing to keep an assistant to supply his place
during his absence. But Mr Banks informed him that
he was objected to by some clergymen in the Board of
Longitude, who had the direction of this business, on
account of his religious principles. &ldquo;Whether,&rdquo; said
Huxley, in commenting on this circumstance in the
course of his speech at the unveiling of the Priestley
statue in Birmingham in 1874, &ldquo;these worthy ecclesiastics
feared that Priestley&rsquo;s presence among the ship&rsquo;s
company might expose his Majesty&rsquo;s sloop <i>Resolution</i> to
the fate which aforetime befell a certain ship that went
from Joppa to Tarshish, or whether they were alarmed
lest a Socinian should undermine that piety which in the
days of Commodore Trunnion so strikingly characterised
sailors, does not appear.&rdquo; The appointment was given
to Reinhold Forster, a man, as Priestley fully admitted,
far better qualified for the position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Becomes literary companion to Lord Shelburne&mdash;Goes
abroad&mdash;His visit to Paris&mdash;His scientific work at
Calne and in London&mdash;Continues his theological and
metaphysical studies&mdash;His growing unpopularity&mdash;Leaves
Lord Shelburne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley continued at Leeds for about six years.
Although very happy there he was tempted to leave
Mill Hill Chapel to enter the service of Lord Shelburne.
How he was regarded by his flock may be gleaned from
the addresses which were presented to him on the eve
of his departure; these, together with his own farewell
letter, are still preserved among the Chapel books of
Mill Hill. But a stipend of one hundred guineas a
year, and a house which was not adequate to contain a
family now increased by the birth of two sons, and
with no possibility of making any provision for them in
the event of his death, induced him to accept Lord
Shelburne&rsquo;s proposals.</p>
<p>Lord Shelburne, afterwards first Marquis of Lansdowne,
one of the most enlightened of the many
politicians who sought to direct the destinies of this
kingdom during the stormy times of the last thirty
years of the eighteenth century, had been Secretary of
State in Pitt&rsquo;s administration of 1766, but had been
dismissed from office in 1768 on account of his conciliatory
policy towards America, and at this particular
time was living in retirement at Bowood. Under these
circumstances his lordship, a man of culture and fond
of literature, sought the companionship of some kindred
spirit. Through the good offices of Dr Price, a mutual
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
friend, he was led to make Priestley so generous an
offer&mdash;viz., two and a half times his Leeds salary, a
pleasant house at Calne in the summer and a house in
town during the winter, and a retiring allowance for
life should their connection be dissolved&mdash;that our
philosopher was constrained to accept a position which,
despite its perils and possible constraints, was so alluring.
The engagement seems to have given satisfaction also
to Priestley&rsquo;s friends, if we may judge from the following
extract from one of Wedgwood&rsquo;s letters to his
partner at Etruria, Thomas Bentley of Liverpool, one
of the founders of the Warrington Academy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear of Dr Priestley&rsquo;s noble appointment,
taking it for granted that he is to go on writing and publishing
with the same freedom he now does, otherwise I had much
rather he still remained in Yorkshire.&rdquo; Meteyard, II. 451.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their political sentiments, and in their views on the
great questions which at that time divided parties,
the two men had much in common. Lord Shelburne
was certainly not unaware of Priestley&rsquo;s political proclivities,
and the pamphlet he had written at Franklin&rsquo;s
instigation on the American question probably expressed
his Lordship&rsquo;s own sentiments. At the same time
Priestley was under no obligation to serve Lord
Shelburne politically, and there is no evidence that
any such service was either expected or rendered. His
office was nominally that of librarian, but he had little
to do in that capacity beyond arranging and cataloguing
the books and numerous manuscripts at Bowood and
Lansdowne House and making an index of Lord
Shelburne&rsquo;s private papers. Indeed, Lord Shelburne
treated him rather as a companion and friend than as a
servant, taking him, in the second year of his engagement,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
on a journey through Flanders, Holland and
Germany as far as Strasburg, and spending a month in
Paris. The time he spent on the Continent made him
sensible of the benefit of foreign travel, even without
the advantage of much conversation with foreigners.
Indeed, he says the very sight of new countries, buildings
and customs of an unfamiliar type, even the very
hearing of a fresh language, however unintelligible,
stimulates and widens the mind and gives it new ideas.
He saw everything to the best advantage and without
any anxiety or trouble, and he had an opportunity of
meeting and conversing with every person of eminence
wherever he went, the political characters by Lord
Shelburne&rsquo;s connections and the literary and scientific
ones by his own. One of these was Magellan, or
Magalh&aelig;ns, a Portuguese Jesuit descended from the
great navigator of that name. He resided in England,
where he died in, or shortly before, 1790. He had
early information on scientific matters from abroad, and
was frequently employed in procuring English instruments
for foreigners. He was a Fellow of the Royal
Society and an active correspondent of Lavoisier&rsquo;s, to
whom he sent all scientific memoirs published in
England, Priestley&rsquo;s among the number. Magellan
was the subject of a notable trial at law&mdash;one of the
last indeed of its kind in England. He was indicted at
the suit of a common informer under the statute against
saying Mass, but the suit, which was heard before Lord
Mansfield, was dismissed on some point of legal
informality.</p>
<p>It was, no doubt, mainly through Magellan that
Priestley was brought into the society of that brilliant
galaxy of men of science which at that period was the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
glory of France. In some respects he was out of
sympathy with this environment, and, as he confesses,
soon tired of Paris. Priestley never obtruded his
religious convictions on any company he might be in;
at the same time he never forgot that he was a Christian
and a minister of religion. What is now called
Agnosticism was at least as prevalent during the latter
half of the eighteenth century as at any period of the
history of Europe. Priestley tells us that a great part
of the company he saw at Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s did not
really know what Christianity was, and Lord Shelburne
numbered among his friends and political associates
almost all who were intellectually eminent at that time
in this country. He was not unprepared, therefore, to
find that all the philosophers to whom he was introduced
at Paris were unbelievers in Christianity and even
professed Atheists. He was told, indeed, by some of
them that he was the only person they had ever met
with, of whose understanding they had any opinion,
who professed to believe Christianity. It was this experience
which caused Priestley to write his <i>Letters to
a Philosophical Unbeliever</i>. He says that as he had
conversed so much with unbelievers at home and
abroad he thought he should be able to combat their
prejudices with advantage. Indeed, he was wont to say
that the greatest satisfaction he received from the
success of his philosophical pursuits arose from the
genuine weight it gave to his attempts to defend the
principles of Christianity and to free it from those
corruptions which prevent its reception with philosophical
and thinking persons.</p>
<p>Of the many advantages he enjoyed through his connection
with Lord Shelburne, Priestley was always
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
fully sensible. It came to him at the most opportune
period of his career, and in the full tide of his intellectual
vigour. The years he spent in this association
were, so far at least as science is concerned, the most
fruitful of his life. Lord Shelburne was a generous
patron, and particularly encouraged Priestley in his
chemical inquiries, affording him ample opportunity for
their prosecution and defraying much of the expense
they occasioned. He had pleasure in witnessing his
experiments, and frequently requested him to exhibit
them to his guests, particularly to foreigners, by whom
a knowledge of Priestley&rsquo;s work was thus spread
abroad.</p>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s energies were, however, not wholly
engrossed by his scientific labours. Theology and
metaphysics still claimed much of his time, and to
this period belongs the concluding portion of his
<i>Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion</i> and his
<i>Harmony of the Gospels</i>, and his <i>Disquisitions relating to
Matter and Spirit</i>. He also at this time wrote some <i>Miscellaneous
Observations relating to Education</i>, and published
his Warrington <i>Lectures on Oratory and Criticism</i>, which
he dedicated to his patron&rsquo;s eldest son, Lord Fitzmaurice.</p>
<p>Certain of these publications occasioned considerable
uproar at the time of their appearance: the outcry
indeed was such, he says, as could hardly have been
imagined. He was attacked in almost every newspaper,
and in the greater number of the periodicals, as an unbeliever
in revelation and no better than an Atheist.
In the preface to his <i>Institutes of Natural and Revealed
Religion</i> he had been led to question the principles of
Reid, Beattie and Oswald with respect to their doctrine
of <i>common sense</i>, which they had made to supersede all
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
rational inquiry into the subject of religion, and he
subsequently developed the attack in a separate publication.
He expressed his belief in the doctrine of
philosophical necessity and his admiration of Hartley&rsquo;s
theory of the human mind. He had uttered some doubt
of the immateriality of the sentient principle in man, and
after giving, as he says, the closest attention to the
subject, he was firmly persuaded that man is wholly
material, and that our only prospect of immortality is
from the Christian doctrine of a resurrection.</p>
<p>Priestley clearly recognised that many of these publications
were not calculated to improve his relations with
Lord Shelburne. Indeed, he says several attempts
were made by Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s friends, though none by
himself, to dissuade him from persisting in them.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In order to proceed with the greatest caution in a business of
such moment I desired some of my learned friends, and
especially Dr Price, to peruse the work before it was published,
and the remarks that he made upon it led to a free and friendly
discussion of the several subjects of it, which are afterwards
published jointly, and it remains a proof of the possibility of
discussing subjects mutually considered as of the greatest importance
with the most perfect good-temper and without the
least diminution of friendship.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s political enemies were not slow to
take advantage of the outcry raised against Priestley
by the orthodox and to strike at the patron through the
philosopher.</p>
<p>It is obvious, from Priestley&rsquo;s letters to his friends at
about this period, that he was sensible that his relations
with Pitt&rsquo;s Secretary of State had become somewhat
strained, and when he received an intimation through
Dr Price that Lord Shelburne wished to give him an
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
establishment in Ireland, where he had large property,
he interpreted this as signifying that the Minister desired
that their connection should be severed. They parted
amicably, Lord Shelburne continuing to pay him the
promised annuity of &pound;150 until the end of his days, paying
it, too, contrary to the insinuation of his enemies, with
perfect punctuality. That there was no unfriendly feeling
on the part of Lord Shelburne at a separation which
seemed to be dictated solely by considerations of political
exigency would appear from the circumstance that a
few years later he sent a common friend to Priestley,
who was then settled in Birmingham, to invite him to
resume his old position, accompanying his request with
expressions which left no doubt of the value he set
upon the companionship. Sensible as Priestley was of
Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s feelings towards him, he was in no
mind to return to a situation which experience had
shown might be incompatible with independence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Removes to London&mdash;Declines a pension&mdash;Renews his
acquaintance with Franklin&mdash;Goes to Birmingham&mdash;Becomes
a member of the Lunar Society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On leaving Calne, Priestley repaired to London. His
position was somewhat precarious, as he had practically
nothing but his allowance from Lord Shelburne to
support him. This, although larger than the stipend he
had enjoyed at Leeds, was barely sufficient for his
growing family. Friends however were not wanting to
come to his assistance. Indeed, during his residence
at Calne, some of them observing, as they said, that many
of his experiments had not been carried to their proper
extent on account of the expense that would have
attended them, proposed to supply him with whatever
sums he should want for that purpose and named a
hundred pounds per annum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This large subscription I declined,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;lest the discovery
of it (by the use that I should, of course, make of it)
should give umbrage to Lord Shelburne; but I consented to
accept forty pounds per annum, which from that time he (Dr
Fothergill) regularly paid me from the contribution of himself,
Sir Theodore Jansen, Mr Constable and Sir George Savile.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence is characteristic of Priestley and of much
of his autobiography. Probably no man with so many
enemies had such troops of friends, and certainly none
had so many and such generous benefactors. And the
measure of their beneficence was only equalled by that of
Priestley&rsquo;s gratitude and sense of obligation. Indeed, he
says the chief object he had in putting together his
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
memoirs was that he thought it right to leave behind
him some account of his friends and benefactors, and
accordingly we find that the incidents in his career are
dwelt upon by him rather with the idea of illustrating
his indebtedness to others than as records of his own
achievements.</p>
<p>On his removal to London, where he contemplated
resuming his profession as a teacher, Dr Fothergill and
his co-subscribers considerably increased his allowance
for experiments, whilst at the same time other friends
were not less zealous that he should have the means to
pursue his theological studies and to publish the fruits
of his labours.</p>
<p>Indeed, all who could in any way assist seemed to vie
with one another in help. Parker, the optician of Fleet
Street, supplied him with every instrument that he wanted
in glass, and Wedgwood, the potter, sent him innumerable
retorts, tubes and other articles of clay. Without such
assistance he could not have carried on his experiments,
except on a very small scale and under great disadvantages.</p>
<p>During Lord Rockingham&rsquo;s administration, and
subsequently at the beginning of that of Mr Pitt, some
suggestions were made to provide Priestley with a pension
to assist in defraying the expense of his inquiries.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>He however declined all overtures of this kind,
wishing, as he said, to preserve himself independent of
everything connected with the court, and preferring the
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
assistance of individuals who were lovers of liberty as
well as of science.</p>
<p>His winter&rsquo;s residence in London threw him constantly
into the society of his old friend Franklin; indeed, he
says, as members of the same club few days passed
without their seeing one another, and their friendship
ripened into the closest intimacy.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that this intercourse with Franklin
not only led Priestley to the study of natural science,
but quickened and fostered his love of civil and political
liberty. Priestley in his autobiography does ample
justice to Franklin&rsquo;s efforts to maintain the union of the
American Colonies with this country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But Franklin,&rdquo; says Mr Choate (Inaugural address as
President of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, October
23, 1903), &ldquo;was more than a staunch Loyalist. He was an
Imperialist in the most stalwart sense of the word, and on a
very broad gauge.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His biographer, Parton, truly says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was one of Franklin&rsquo;s most cherished opinions that the
greatness of England and the happiness of America depended
chiefly upon their being cordially united. The &lsquo;country&rsquo;
which Franklin loved was not England nor America, but the
great and glorious Empire which these two united to form.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In writing to Lord Kames, he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have long been of opinion that the foundations of the
future grandeur and stability of the British Empire lie in
America; and though, like other foundations, they are low and
little now, they are nevertheless broad and strong enough to
support the greatest political structure that human wisdom ever
yet erected.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1774 he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It has long appeared to me that the only true British policy
was that which aimed at the good of the whole British Empire,
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
not that which sought the advantage of one part in the disadvantage
of the others; therefore all measures of procuring gain to the
Mother Country arising from loss to her colonies, and all gain
to the Colonies arising from or occasioning loss to Britain,
especially where the gain was small and the loss was great ...
I in my own mind condemned as improper, partial, unjust and
mischievous, tending to create dissensions and weaken that
union on which the strength, solidity and duration of the
Empire greatly depended; and I opposed, as far as my little
powers went, all proceedings, either here or in America, that in
my opinion had such tendency.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s testimony is no less explicit. He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The unity of the British Empire in all its parts was a
favourite idea of his. He used to compare it to a beautiful
china vase which, if ever broken, could never be put together
again, and so great an admirer was he of the British constitution
that he said he saw no inconvenience from its being extended
over a great part of the globe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the autobiography we further read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I can bear witness that he (Franklin) was so far from promoting,
as was generally supposed, that he took every method in
his power to prevent a rupture between the two countries. He
urged so much the doctrine of forbearance, that for some time
he was unpopular with the Americans on that account, as too
much a friend to Great Britain. His advice to them was to
bear everything for the present, as they were sure in time to
outgrow all their grievances, as it could not be in the power of
the Mother Country to oppress them long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He dreaded the war, and often said that if the difference
should come to an open rupture it would be a war of <i>ten years</i>,
and he should not live to see the end of it. In reality the war
lasted nearly eight years, but he did not live to see the happy
termination of it. That the issue would be favourable to
America he never doubted. The English, he used to say,
may take all our great towns, but that will not give them
possession of the country. The last day that he spent in
England, having given out that he should leave London the
day before, we passed together without any other company;
and much of the time was employed in reading American
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
newspapers, especially accounts of the reception which the
&lsquo;Boston Port Bill&rsquo; met with in America; and as he read the
addresses to the inhabitants of Boston from the places in the
neighbourhood the tears trickled down his cheeks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Franklin thought of Priestley may be gathered
from the following extract from one of his letters to
Vaughan, one of Priestley&rsquo;s Warrington pupils, written
in October 1788 after his return to America:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Remember me affectionately to the good Dr Price and to
the honest heretic, Dr Priestley. I do not call him honest by
way of distinction, for I think all the heretics I have known
have been virtuous men. They have the virtue of fortitude, or
they would not venture to own their heresy; and they cannot
afford to be deficient in any of the other virtues, as that would
give advantage to their many enemies; and they have not, like
orthodox sinners, such a number of friends to excuse or justify
them. Do not, however, mistake me. It is not to my good
friend&rsquo;s heresy that I impute his honesty. On the contrary &rsquo;tis
his honesty that has brought upon him the character of heretic.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1780, at the suggestion of his brother-in-law, John
Wilkinson, one of his truest friends, Priestley was led
to take up his residence in Birmingham. There were
many circumstances which made this step desirable. In
Birmingham he had friends prepared to welcome him
and society in every way sympathetic and congenial.
Moreover, he was desirous of resuming his ministerial
duties, which had been intermitted for the past six or
seven years, and an opportunity of doing so, with a
congregation not less liberal than he had served at Leeds,
offered itself, owing to the approaching retirement of
Mr Hawkes from the charge of the New Meeting. As
regards his philosophical pursuits he had the convenience
of good workmen of every kind and he could count
upon the practical sympathy and interest of men like
Watt, his partner Boulton, Keir, Withering, Wedgwood,
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
Erasmus Darwin, and the Galtons, all at that
time living in Birmingham or in its vicinity. These men
and their friends constituted indeed a cultured society
without a parallel in any other town in the kingdom,
except possibly in the Metropolis. The more eminent
of them formed themselves into an association, to which
frequent reference is made in the biographical literature
of the period, on account of the part which it played in
the social and intellectual life of the Midlands.</p>
<p>The Lunar Society of Birmingham appears to have been
formed about the year 1766 by Matthew Boulton and
Erasmus Darwin, at that time resident in Birmingham.
The members were about ten or a dozen in number and
met at each other&rsquo;s houses for dinner once a month on
the Monday nearest to the full moon, in order to have
the benefit of its light in returning home. They were
in the habit of sitting down to dinner at two o&rsquo;clock and
their meeting lasted until eight.</p>
<p>Each member was allowed to bring a friend, and
thus it happened that many distinguished men were
recipients, at various times, of the Club&rsquo;s hospitality.
Among them we find Wedgwood, Sir Joseph Banks,
Sir William Herschel, Smeaton, the builder of the
Eddystone Lighthouse; Dr Samuel Parr, the critic;
Afzelius, the teacher of Berzelius; Solander, the well-known
naturalist and traveller; De Luc and other names
eminent in the literary and scientific annals of the
century.</p>
<p>As might be supposed from what we know of its
founders and their friends the constitution of the society
was on the broadest possible basis. &ldquo;We had nothing
to do,&rdquo; says Priestley, &ldquo;with the <i>religious</i> or political
principles of each other; we were united by a common
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
love of <i>science</i>, which we thought sufficient to bring
together persons of all distinctions&mdash;Christians, Jews,
Mahometans and heathens, Monarchists and Republicans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invitations issued by the host were usually
accompanied by some intimation of the nature of the
impending symposium. Thus Watt writes to Darwin,
under date Jan. 3, 1781:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I beg that you would impress on your memory the idea
that you promised to dine with sundry men of learning at my
house on Monday next, and that you will realise the idea. For
your encouragement there is a new book to be cut up, and it
is to be determined whether or not heat is a compound of
phlogiston and empyreal air, and whether a mirror can reflect
the heat of the fire. I give you a friendly warning that you
may be found wanting whichever opinion you adopt in the
latter question, therefore be cautious. If you are meek and
humble, perhaps you may be told what light is made of, and
also how to make it, and the theory proved both by synthesis
and analysis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The discussions of the philosophic <i>convives</i> were not,
however, confined exclusively to chemistry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The period,&rdquo; says Mr Carrington Bolton, &ldquo;was one of great
activity in the world of science; Laplace was applying his
mathematical genius to the problems of astronomy; Herschel was
sweeping the heavens with his gigantic telescopes; Galvani and
Volta were laying the foundations of a revolution in electricity;
Count Rumford in Bavaria was devoting his great energy to
industrial and social economy; Hatton and Werner were
geologising in their respective countries; Ha&uuml;y was systematising
the innumerable crystalline forms occurring in nature; the
Montgolfier brothers were experimenting with air-balloons
and prophesying the yet unsolved problem of a&euml;rial navigation;
Captain James Cook returned from his memorable voyages
around the world, full of adventures and novelties in nature:
the application of steam to the driving of land carriages and the
propelling of boats was gradually being perfected by patience
and genius. These, together with the metaphysical and even
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
the political questions of the day, must have engrossed the
attention of the talented friends who dined together at the full
moon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A picturesque account of the Club is given in Mrs
Schimmelpenninck&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>. Mary Ann Schimmelpenninck
(<i>n&eacute;e</i> Galton) was the daughter of Mr Samuel
Galton, a wealthy patron of letters and a man of considerable
intellectual ability. He was interested in
scientific pursuits and was a fellow of the Royal Society.
His house at Barr, about seven or eight miles from
Birmingham, was a notable place in the social life of the
district, and the Lunar Society held some of its most
delightful meetings under his hospitable roof, as Mrs
Schimmelpenninck recalls. She thus writes of Dr
Priestley:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A man of admirable simplicity, gentleness and kindness
of heart, united with great acuteness of intellect. I can never
forget the impression produced on me by the serene expression
of his countenance.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his <i>Memoirs</i> Richard Lovell Edgeworth says of
the Society that it consisted of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Men of very different characters, but all devoted to
literature and science. This mutual intimacy has never been
broken but by death, nor have any of the number failed to
distinguish themselves in science or literature. Some may
think I ought, with due modesty, to except myself. Mr Keir,
with his knowledge of the world and good sense; Dr Small,
with his benevolence and profound sagacity; ... Boulton, with
his mobility, quick perception and bold adventure; Watt,
with his strong inventive faculty, undeviating steadiness and
bold resources; Darwin, with his imagination, science and
poetical excellence; and Day, with his unwearied research
after truth, his integrity and eloquence, proved altogether such
a society as few men have had the good fortune to live with;
such an assemblage of friends as fewer still have had the
happiness to possess and keep through life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>There can be no doubt that Priestley&rsquo;s coming to
Birmingham contributed greatly to the interest of the
meetings of the Lunar Society and reacted beneficially
on Priestley himself by stimulating his activity and
affording him the sympathy of congenial minds not less
interested than he was in the study of natural science.
As each meeting came round he was certain to find a
gathering curious to hear of his latest experiments and
eager to discuss with him their bearing upon the
chemical doctrine of the period.</p>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s influence and position in the Society may
be inferred from the circumstance that almost immediately
after he joined it Pneumatic Chemistry became one
of the chief topics of discussion. This is amply demonstrated
in the correspondence of its various members,
which has been preserved to us in the biographies of
Watt, Wedgwood and others, and in the scientific
letters of Priestley, which have been collected and
edited by Mr H. Carrington Bolton. One direct outcome
of this interest is seen in Watt&rsquo;s connection with the
History of the Discovery of the Composition of Water.
It is reasonably certain that if Watt and Priestley had
not foregathered round the festive board of the Lunar
Society, Watt would not have been stimulated to
theorise on the meaning and true significance of
Priestley&rsquo;s experiments, and as to their bearing upon
the fact that Priestley&rsquo;s dephlogisticated air (oxygen) and
inflammable air (hydrogen) enter into the composition of
water. Watt&rsquo;s claim to be considered as the discoverer
of the composition of water rests upon his interpretation
of the experimental phenomena made known to
him by Priestley shortly after his arrival in Birmingham.
The Water Controversy&mdash;a controversy which keenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
excited the entire scientific world a generation or so
ago&mdash;may be said to have arisen from the accident of
Priestley&rsquo;s removal to Birmingham and to his association
with the Lunar Society.</p>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s connection with the Society influenced the
progress of chemistry in this country both directly and
indirectly. As already stated, he himself was greatly
stimulated to accumulate chemical facts by his association
with men like Boulton, Watt, Wedgwood, Keir,
Darwin, who loved knowledge for its own sake, but
who were at the same time quite alive to the material
benefits which they and their fellow-men might derive
from the pursuit of scientific inquiry. The measure of
their interest may be gauged by the extent of their
support, and by the readiness with which they furnished
Priestley with the means to carry on his investigations.
Priestley not only freely communicated to them the
results of his labours, but he incidentally fixed their
attention on a class of phenomena which, more than any
other, were calculated to afford an insight into the real
nature of chemical change, and to lead to a rational
explanation of chemical phenomena.</p>
<p>Priestley was not consciously a casuist, but there can
be no question that the interpretation which his active
and ingenious mind occasionally led him to place upon his
work not only served to blind himself, but was the means
of obscuring the truth for a time from others. We have
only to read the correspondence, already more than
once alluded to, to find ample proof that such was the
case. In a letter to Wedgwood, of March 30, 1781,
Boulton writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have long talked of phlogiston without knowing what
we talked about; but now that Dr Priestley hath brought the
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
matter to light we can pour that element out of one vessel into
another; can tell how much of it by accurate measurement is
necessary to reduce a calx to a metal, which is easily done, and
without putting that calx into contact with any visible thing.
In short, this goddess of levity can be measured and weighed
like other matter. For the rest, I refer you to the doctor
himself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following year (March 21, 1782) we find
Priestley also writing to Wedgwood:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Before my late experiments, phlogiston was indeed almost
given up by the Lunar Society, but now it seems to be re-established.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How difficult it was to convince Priestley may be seen
from the following extract from a letter to his friend
Franklin, who was then in Paris, written at about the
same time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr"><span class="smaller">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Birmingham</span>, <i>June 24, 1782</i>.</span></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Please to inform the Duc de Rochefoucauld, whose
civilities to me I remember with pleasure, that my experiments
are certainly inconsistent with Mr Lavoisier&rsquo;s supposition of
there being no such thing as phlogiston, and that it is the
addition of air, and not the loss of anything, that converts a
metal into a calx. In their usual state calces of metals do not
contain air, but that may be expelled by heat, and after this I
reduce them to a perfect metallic state by nothing but
inflammable air, which they imbibe <i>in toto</i>, without any decomposition.
I lately reduced 101 ounce measures of this air to
two by calx of lead, and that small remainder was still
inflammable. I explain Mr Lavoisier&rsquo;s experiments by
supposing that <i>precipitate per se</i> [mercuric oxide] contains all
the phlogiston of the metal mercury, but in a different state;
but I can show other calces which also contain more
phlogiston than the metals themselves. That mercury in its
metallic state does contain phlogiston or inflammable air is
evident from the production of nitrous air by the solution of it
in spirits of nitre, and I make <i>nitrous air</i> from nothing but
<i>nitrous vapour</i> and inflammable air; so that it indisputably
consists of these two ingredients. I have already ascertained
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
the proportion of inflammable air that enters into the composition
of lead, tin, copper and silver, and am proceeding
with the other metals as fast as I can. When the whole is
completed I shall give you a further account of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am exceedingly concerned to find that it is so difficult
a thing to make <i>peace</i>; but I hope before the campaign is over
all parties will have had enough of <i>war</i>, and be sensible that
they will gain nothing by continuing it. If I had any voice in
the business, the prospect of seeing you in this country
would be a strong additional motive to accelerate the
negotiations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the greatest respect and every good wish.&mdash;I am,
dear sir, yours sincerely,
<span class="lr"><span class="sc">J. Priestley</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were already many indications prior to 1780
that men were beginning to be troubled as to the
sufficiency of Stahl&rsquo;s generalisation to account for the
rapidly-accumulating mass of facts which the application
of quantitative chemistry to the study of natural
phenomena was bringing to light. Priestley&rsquo;s advent in
Birmingham certainly retarded by the weight of his
authority the growth in heterodoxy in that particular
among the members of the Lunar Society, and indirectly
therefore all whom they could influence.</p>
<p>The following letter from Keir is typical of many
which passed between the members of the Society in
reference to Priestley&rsquo;s work and of the discussions
which it occasioned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Keir to Priestley.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The more we discover of Nature, the further we are removed
from the conceit of our being able to understand the operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish M. Berthollet and his associates would relate their
facts in plain prose, that all men might understand them, and
reserve their poetry of the new nomenclature for their theoretical
commentaries on the facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wished much to call on you to hear of the progress of
your experiments, but have been much indisposed with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
rheumatism. I long to know what acids you get with the
other inflammable airs. If you get different acids from the
inflammable air made from sulphur and water, that made from
marine acid and copper (for I would avoid iron on account of its
plumbago and carbon), and that made from charcoal and
water:&mdash;I say, if these acids are different (suppose, according
to my notions, vitriolic, marine and fixed air), then will you not
be obliged to admit that there is not one inflammable but many
inflammables, which opinion you now think as heterodox as
the Athanasian System.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, there are wonderful resources in the dispute about
Phlogiston, by which either party can evade, so that I am less
sanguine than you are in my hopes of seeing it terminated. One
consolation remains, that in your experiments you cannot fail
of discovering something perhaps of as great or greater importance
for us to know.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, even in the Club itself there was at
least one man who came under the influence of Priestley,
but who eventually emancipated himself, and this was
Withering, who, we are informed, read to them &ldquo;a
humorous piece in verse entitled &lsquo;The Life and Death
of Phlogiston,&rsquo; which was long remembered for its
clever treatment and pointed wit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Priestley&rsquo;s influence still reigned in the Club,
even down to 1803, may be inferred from the introduction
to his essay, &ldquo;The Doctrine of Phlogiston
Established&rdquo;&mdash;the last of his scientific papers&mdash;in
which he says, &ldquo;And now that Dr Crawford is dead,
I hardly know of any person, except my friends of the
Lunar Society of Birmingham, who adhere to the
doctrine of Phlogiston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As regards the history of the Lunar Society there is
little more to tell. One by one its members submitted
themselves to the arrest of the &ldquo;fell sergeant,&rdquo; and
eventually Keir, Watt, and Boulton, the founder, were
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
the only survivors, and its meetings were gradually
discontinued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says its historian, &ldquo;the influence exerted by the
Society did not die; it had stimulated inquiry and quickened
the zeal for knowledge of all who had come within its influence,
and this spirit diffused and propagated itself in all directions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leonard Horner, who visited Soho in 1809, thus
refers to the continued moral influence of the association:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The remnant of the Lunar Society,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and the
fresh remembrance in others of the remarkable men who composed
it, are very interesting. The impression which they
made is not yet worn out, but shows itself to the second and
third generation, in a spirit of scientific curiosity and free
inquiry, which even yet makes some stand against Toryism and
the love of gain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Priestley at Birmingham&mdash;His theological work there&mdash;His
love of literature&mdash;His catholicity&mdash;His personal
characteristics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1784 Priestley brought out a revised edition of the
work on which his fame as a man of science mainly
rests, under the title of &ldquo;<i>Experiments and Observations
on Different Kinds of Air</i>; and other branches of Natural
Philosophy connected with the Subject. In three
volumes, being the former six abridged and methodised.
With many Additions. London, 1790. 3 vols. 8vo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter to his friend Keir we find an allusion to
this matter. He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am working like a horse at the new arrangements of my
<i>6 vols. of Experiments</i>. It is a tedious business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of an attempt to dedicate this work to
the Prince of Wales? The King I shall never think of in any
such light, nor the Prince, unless it be possible that he will be
a real patron of science and could look upon it in some other
light than that of an honour to myself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting account of Priestley at this period of
his life is to be found in the Memoirs of the French
geologist, Faujar St Fond, who visited Birmingham some
time after Priestley&rsquo;s settlement there. He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dr Priestley received me with the greatest kindness. He
presented me to his wife and his daughter, who were distinguished
by vivacity, intelligence and gentleness of manner.
The young lady spoke to me of one of her brothers, who was
then finishing his education at Geneva and to whom she seemed
very much attached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building in which Dr Priestley made his chemical and
philosophical experiments was detached from his house to avoid
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
the danger of fire. It consisted of several apartments on a
ground floor. Upon entering it we were struck with a simple
and ingenious apparatus for making experiments on inflammable
gas extracted from iron and water reduced to vapour. The
tube, which was thick and long, was made of red copper and
cast in one piece to avoid joinings. The part exposed to the
fire was thicker than the rest. Into this tube he introduced
cuttings or filings of iron, and instead of dropping in the water
he preferred making it enter in vapour. The furnace destined
for this operation was supplied with coke made of coal, which
is the best of all combustibles for the intensity and equality of
its heat. By these means he obtained a considerable quantity
of inflammable gas of great lightness and without any smell. He
observed to me, that by increasing the apparatus and using iron
or copper tubes of a large calibre, aerostatic balloons might be
filled with far less trouble and expense than by vitriolic acid.
Dr Priestley allowed me to take a drawing of this new apparatus
for the purpose of communicating it to the French chemists
who are engaged in the same pursuit....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr Priestley did not regard the experiments made relative to
the decomposition of water as satisfactory. He could not admit
the fact to be demonstrated so long as the gas was only obtained
through the medium of iron, a metal which is itself susceptible
of inflammability; but he waited with impatience for the result
of the experiments of the French chemists, particularly those
of Lavoisier, who had invented and caused to be constructed
an extensive apparatus for the same object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The decomposition of water,&rsquo; said this indefatigable
philosopher, addressing himself to me, &lsquo;is of so much importance
in Natural Philosophy, and would occupy so distinguished
a place among the phenomena of the universe, that far from
admitting the fact upon slight evidence, and as it were from
enthusiasm, it were rather to be wished that all objections that
may be made, and which will still long continue to be made
against this theory were completely refuted; in the conflict of
opinions, truth may at last be obtained. But I have still so
many doubts upon this subject, and I have so many experiments
to make, both <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, that I can as yet regard the greatest
as only started.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr Priestley has embellished his solitude with a philosophical
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
cabinet, which contains all the instruments necessary for his
experiments, and a library rendered valuable by a choice of
excellent works. The learned possessor employs himself in a
variety of studies: History, Moral Philosophy and Religion
have all in their turn engaged his pen. An active, intelligent
mind and a natural avidity for knowledge gave him a passion
for experimental philosophy; but the sensibility and gentleness
of his disposition have sometimes directed his attention to pious
and philanthropic studies, which do honour to the goodness of
his heart, since they always have for their object the happiness
of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s time in Birmingham was not, however,
wholly devoted to science and the social joys of the
Lunar Society. Much of it was given to his beloved
theology and to editing the <i>Theological Repository</i>, which
he revived some time after he had settled there. A
few months after his arrival he was invited to take
charge of the congregation of the New Meeting.
With the consent of the congregation his services were
mainly confined to Sunday duty and to catechising and
lecturing.</p>
<p>Of his preaching Miss Hutton has left us an account.
She says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I look upon his character as a preacher to be as amicable
as his character as a philosopher is great. In the pulpit he is
mild, persuasive and unaffected, and his sermons are full of
sound reasoning and good sense. He is not what is called an
orator; he uses no actions, no declamation; but his voice and
manner are those of one friend speaking to another.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His congregation is described as the most liberal in
England, and with many of its members, particularly
Mr Russell, he was on the most intimate and affectionate
terms. During this period he completed his
friendly controversy with the Bishop of Waterford on
the duration of Christ&rsquo;s ministry, and he published a
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
volume of sermons. To the same period belongs his
<i>History of the Corruptions of Christianity</i>, which he
composed and published shortly after his settlement at
Birmingham. This work, which he spoke of as the
most valuable of all his writings, he dedicated to his
&ldquo;dear friend,&rdquo; Theophilus Lindsey, in the hope that
their names may ever be connected as closely after
death as they were connected by friendship during life.
To Lindsey&rsquo;s example of a pure love of truth, and of
the most fearless integrity in asserting it, as evidenced
by the sacrifices he had made to it, Priestley says that he
owed much of his own wishes &ldquo;to imbibe the same spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work, as originally planned, was to be the concluding
part of his <i>Institutes of Natural and Revealed
Religion</i>, but as the matter of it grew it became extended
into a separate treatise, larger, indeed, than the
whole of the Institutes. Its object was to show that
modern Christianity was a departure from the original
scheme, and that the innovations have debased its spirit
and almost annihilated all the happy effects which it was
eminently calculated to produce. Although it had
begun to recover itself from its corrupted state, and
the Reformation was advancing apace, abuses still
continued in many places, even although their virulence
was very generally abated and the number was greatly
increased of those who were most zealous in the profession
of Christianity, whose lives were the greatest
ornament to it, and who hold it in such purity that if
it was fairly exhibited and universally understood it
could hardly fail to recommend itself to the acceptance
of the whole world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But so long as all the Christianity that is known to
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
Heathens, Mahometans and Jews is of a corrupted and debased
kind, and particularly while the profession of it is so much
connected with <i>worldly interest</i>, it is no wonder that mankind in
general refuse to admit it, and that they can even hardly be
prevailed upon to give any attention to the evidence that is
alleged in its favour. Whereas, when the system itself shall
appear to be less liable to objection, it is to be hoped that they
may be brought to give proper attention to it, and to the
evidence on which it rests.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this work Priestley attempted to trace every
&ldquo;corruption&rdquo;&mdash;that is every innovation or departure
from what he conceives to be the original scheme&mdash;to
its proper source and &ldquo;to show what circumstances in
the state of things, and especially of other prevailing
opinions and prejudices, made the alteration, in doctrine
or practice, sufficiently natural, and the introduction
and establishment of it easy.&rdquo; Priestley hoped as a
true rationalist that this historical method would be
found to be one of the most satisfactory modes of
argumentation, in order to prove that what he objected
to was no part of the original scheme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For after the clearest refutation of any particular doctrine
that has been long established in Christian churches it will still
be asked, how, if it be no part of the scheme, it ever came to
be thought so, and to be so generally acquiesced in; and in
many cases the mind will not be perfectly satisfied till such
questions be answered.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are mainly concerned with this remarkable work
as illustrating the character and attributes of its author,
and it is not within our province to give any analysis of
its contents. It must be remembered in connection
with it that Priestley was no longer an Arian; he was
not even a Socinian, as that term was understood by the
immediate followers of Faustus Socinus, who thought it
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
their duty as Christians, and, indeed, essential to
Christianity, to pray to Jesus Christ, notwithstanding
they believed him to be, in Priestley&rsquo;s phrase, a mere
man. Priestley was at this time what he remained
until his death&mdash;a strict Humanitarian, although he
believed in the supernatural power and divine mission
of Christ.</p>
<p>Of the reception which awaited his book he could
not be altogether unprepared. It was received by the
orthodox with a storm of disapproval, and a dozen
pens were immediately set to work to demolish its
doctrine and to defend the principles he so boldly
assailed. Among those who entered the lists the most
formidable was Dr Horsley, then Archdeacon of St
Albans, whose <i>Animadversions</i> were described as &ldquo;at
once nervous, animated and evangelical, but in some
passages too sarcastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It says something for Priestley&rsquo;s position and influence
in the theological world that his book should have met
with the sternest disapprobation in Lutheran, and especially
Calvinistic, circles abroad. It was ordered to be burnt
by the hands of the common hangman at Dordrecht, in
1785&mdash;a sign that the spirit of the Synod of Dort had
survived even two centuries.</p>
<p>Priestley thereupon undertook to collect from the
original writers the state of opinion on the subject in
the age succeeding that of the apostles, and he published
the results of his investigation in his &ldquo;<i>History of Early
Opinion concerning Jesus Christ</i>.&rdquo; In four volumes. 8vo.</p>
<p>This bringing him still more antagonists he retaliated
by writing a pamphlet annually in defence of the Unitarian
doctrine, until it appeared to himself and his friends that
his antagonists produced nothing to which it was of any
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
consequence to reply. The pains that he took to
ascertain the state of early opinions concerning Jesus
Christ, and the great misapprehensions that he says he
perceived in all the ecclesiastical historians, led him to
undertake a <i>General History of the Christian Church to the
Fall of the Western Empire</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you ask me,&rdquo; says the Rev. Alexander Gordon, &ldquo;what
I should reckon Priestley&rsquo;s greatest service to theological
science, I should say that it is to be found in his adoption of
the historical method of investigating the problems of doctrine
and in his special handling of that method. The faith of
Priestley was the precursor of the modern theme of theological
development, though I do not think he used the term. His
term was &lsquo;corruption,&rsquo; a term which, it may be said, begs a
very important question. At any rate it throws into strong
relief the fact, on which all are agreed, that there is, and must
be, some primitive nucleus whence developments proceed. Now
it is the object of all who, for any reason, are interested in the
origin of Christianity to reach this primitive nucleus at its
first, undeveloped and uncorrupted stage. Where are we to
seek it? By universal consent we must go to the New
Testament. There, if anywhere, we shall come upon its traces.
Here the agreement begins and ends. The New Testament
is in all hands. But one man finds the Trinity in it;
another the simplest Monotheism; a third, the papacy;
a fourth, the supremacy of the illuminating spirit. The
same words yield opposite results, because the principles of
interpretation differ. The New Testament is to be interpreted
by the voice of the Church; or by the testimony of the
Creeds; or by the opinions of the Fathers of the first centuries
before the age of dogmatic creeds began at Nic&aelig;a. These
had been the expedients proposed by the Catholic, the
Anglican, the Arian respectively. Socinus had rejected them
all. It cannot matter to me (so, in effect, he contended) what
any Church, or any Creed, or any Father may have said; I go
to the New Testament myself, to read it with my own eyes,
to understand it with my own mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was not the position of Priestley. He thought this as
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
irrational a proceeding as any of those which it superseded.
Even if, by good luck, the true sense were reached, there was
no means of proving it to be such. The New Testament, in
Priestley&rsquo;s view, is not to be construed as a book of enigmas
which might belong to any age. It is not dropped straight out
of heaven into the hands of the man of to-day for him to make
what he will of it. It belongs to a specific period; it was
written for a given class of persons; it was written to be understood.
&lsquo;Therefore,&rsquo; said Priestley, &lsquo;it will be an unanswerable
argument <i>a priori</i> against any particular doctrine being
contained in the Scriptures, that it was never understood to be
so by those persons for whose immediate use the Scriptures
were written, and who must have been much better qualified to
understand them, in that respect at least, than we can pretend
to be at the present day.&rsquo; (<i>Works</i>, vi. 7.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly it is the whole object of Priestley&rsquo;s histories of
doctrine to get at the mind of the common Christian people in
the first age; to make their primary understanding of Scripture
the norm for its true interpretation; and then to trace the process
by which this first impression, this real meaning, suffered
transmutation by the speculative genius of philosophising divines.
Of the Nicene Council he quaintly says, &lsquo;there was no House
of Commons in that assembly.&rsquo; It &lsquo;represented the Christian
Church in no other sense than the House of Lords might be
said to represent the English nation.&rsquo; He conceived that he
could penetrate to this unsophisticated sense of the primitive
believers through the very writings of the Fathers whereby it
had been overlaid and obscured. Their admissions, their
rebukes, their appeals, their laboured arguments, their surviving
conservatisms: all were materials to his purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plan was novel, the conception original, the whole
endeavour strictly scientific in its method and basis. And I do
not think that Priestley&rsquo;s work in this department has received
the full recognition which it rightly claims from us, whether
we regard its spirit or its execution. The progress of
biblical knowledge implies, no doubt, a readjustment of his
argument and a revision of his conclusions. But the readjustment
and revision are effected by the use of principles which
he was the first to set forth and apply. We now go
behind the New Testament just as he went behind the
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
Fathers. The New Testament itself is, to us, largely a record
by help of which we may reach the first impression made by
the life, and work, and word of Christ. In so doing we do
but carry out his suggestions and carry on his method. He is
the genuine precursor of the properly historic treatment of
biblical and theological questions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s action with respect to the Sunday school
movement was another rock of offence to the Established
clergy. This movement began in Birmingham in
1784, and was supported by all denominations. The
High Church party, however, insisted that all children,
irrespective of the religious persuasion of their parents,
should attend the worship of the Established Church
and no other. After some time, and mainly at the
instigation of Priestley, the Dissenters opened their
separate Sunday schools, the Old Meeting in 1787, and
the New Meeting in 1788, and Priestley preached the
first sermon on behalf of the New Meeting Schools in
November 1789, and with his son Joseph took an active
share in the teaching.</p>
<p>Priestley was a sincere lover of literature, and no
man was more sensible of its value to the moral and
intellectual life of communities. In his own case he had
derived so much benefit from a ready access to books
which were beyond his means to purchase that he was
ever willing to lend himself to any well-considered
attempt to open the storehouses of literature, in its
widest sense, as freely as possible, and to do all in his
power to foster the love of reading and the spirit of
inquiry among all classes of persons. In each succeeding
situation&mdash;Needham, Nantwich, Warrington, Leeds&mdash;he
left evidences of his efforts to make books as
accessible as possible to the community of which he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
for the time a member. Leeds still enjoys a striking
example of these efforts in its proprietary library, and
much of its reputation and character is owing to the
wise and enlightened spirit which he infused into its
administration.</p>
<p>As to the library at Birmingham, he eventually succeeded
in giving to it, as Hutton says, &ldquo;that stability
and method without which no institution can prosper.&rdquo;
We are further told that &ldquo;the Society are under many
and great obligations to the learned Doctor; it was him
who altered its original plan and put it on a more
extensive scale; he amended and enlarged the laws and
has paid a great attention to its welfare and growing
interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s action, and more especially the catholicity
he displayed in the selection and admission of such
books as in his judgment tended to the spread of
rationalism, whether in religion or in politics, drew
down upon him the wrath of the Court party, and more
particularly of the beneficed clergy of the town and
district, and the library was vigorously denounced as
&ldquo;a fountain of erroneous opinions, spreading infidelity,
heresy and schism through the whole neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This catholicity is reflected in almost every circumstance
of his daily life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If liberality of sentiment,&rdquo; he wrote on one occasion, &ldquo;be
the result of general and various acquaintance, few men now
living have had a better opportunity of acquiring it than myself.
This has arisen from the great variety of my pursuits, which
has naturally brought me acquainted with persons of all
principles and characters. One day, I remember, I dined in
company with an eminent popish priest; the evening I spent
with philosophers, determined unbelievers; the next morning I
breakfasted, at his own request, with a most zealously orthodox
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
clergyman, Mr Toplady, and the rest of that day I spent with
Dr Jebb, Mr Lindsey and some others, men in all respects
after my own heart. I have since enriched my acquaintance
with that of some very intelligent Jews; and my opponents,
who consider me already as half a Mahometan, will not suppose
that I can have any objection to the society of persons of that
religion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr Samuel Parr, the Prebend of St Paul&rsquo;s, a staunch
friend and true admirer of Priestley, who wrote the
inscription on the tablet to his memory in the New
Meeting House at Birmingham, related the following
characteristic anecdote to Mrs Robert A. Wainwright,
who died in 1891, in her 84th year:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now remember this. I knew your grandfather, Dr
Priestley. He once invited me to dinner at Fair Hill, and I
never was at a more agreeable party in my life. Your grandfather
was at the head of the table. I sat at the bottom. At
your grandfather&rsquo;s right hand was Mr Berington, the Roman
Catholic, and Mr Galton, the Quaker, on his left. Next to
me was Robert Robinson, the Baptist, and Mr Proud, minister
of the New Jerusalem Church.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the five guests were remarkable men and distinguished
in their several Churches. Dr Parr, one of
the most erudite scholars of his time and an acute critic,
an inveterate Whig, and a political ally of Fox, Burke
and North, was Vicar of Wadenhoe in Northamptonshire,
although he resided, as assistant curate, at
Hatton, near Warwick, where he had an excellent
library. Berington wrote a <i>Literary History of the Middle
Ages</i>, and the <i>History of Abelard and Heloise</i>. Robert
Robinson, of Cambridge, was the author of the <i>History
of Baptism</i>, <i>Ecclesiastical Researches</i>, <i>Village Sermons</i>
and other books. The Swedenborgian minister was
the chief defender of the New Jerusalem Church
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
in England, and was engaged in controversy with
Priestley.</p>
<p>A contemporary account of Priestley at this period of
his life describes him as about the middle stature, or
five feet eight inches high; slender and well proportioned;
of fair complexion, eyes grey and sparkling
with intelligence, and his whole countenance expressive
of the benignity of his heart. He often smiled, but
seldom laughed. He was extremely active and agile in
his motions; he walked fast and very erect, and his
deportment was dignified. His usual dress was a black
coat without a cape, a fine linen or cambric stock, a
cocked hat, a powdered wig, shoes and buckles. He
commonly walked with a long cane in his right hand,
and was an excellent pedestrian. &ldquo;The whole of his
dress was remarkably clean, and this purity of person
and simple dignity of manners evinced that philosophic
propriety which prevailed throughout his conduct as a
private individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose about six o&rsquo;clock and commonly retired to his
study, where he continued until eight, when he met his
family at breakfast. He breakfasted on tea, and after
breakfast again went to his study, accompanied by his
amanuensis. He often devoted the whole of his
morning to composition, or divided his morning
between the study and the laboratory. When
engaged in experimental work he commonly wore a
white apron and canvas covers drawn over his sleeves.
He dined at one o&rsquo;clock and was very abstemious. He
seldom drank wine or beer. In the afternoon he
usually took a walk, frequently to Birmingham, and
spent some time at the office where his works were
being printed. He supped at eight, the meal usually
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
consisting of vegetables, and retired to rest shortly after
ten. He was extremely methodical in his habits and a
rigid economist of time.</p>
<p>At Daventry he began the practice, which he continued
up to within three or four days of his death, of
keeping, in Peter Annet&rsquo;s system of shorthand, a diary in
which he noted where he had been, the nature of his
employment, what he had been reading, and any hints
or suggestions of future work which had occurred to
him, when he rose and the hour at which he went to
bed. He was very methodical in his reading and in the
alternation of his studies and relaxation. He never
read a book without determining in his own mind when
he would finish it. Had he a work to transcribe, he
would fix a time for its completion. At the beginning
of each year he arranged the plan he intended to pursue,
and at the close he reviewed the general situation of his
affairs and took stock of the progress he had made,
noting whether the execution of his plan exceeded or
fell short of his expectations. It was this regular
apportionment of his time, and the habits of method and
order in the arrangement of his business which he
adopted in early life, and from which he never materially
deviated, together with his uniformly good health, his
industry and aptitude for rapid work, which enabled
him to achieve what he did. It was, he says, a great
advantage to him that he never was under the necessity
of retiring from company in order to compose anything.
Being fond of domestic life he got a habit of writing on
any subject by the parlour fire with his wife and
children about him, and occasionally talking to them
without experiencing any inconvenience from such
interruptions. When he was a young author (although
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
he did not publish anything until he was about thirty)
strictures on his writings gave him some disturbance,
though he believed even then less than they do most
others; but after some time things of that kind hardly
affected him at all, and on this account he thinks he may
be said to have been well formed for public controversy.
But what always made him easy in any controversy in
which he was engaged was his fixed resolution frankly
to acknowledge any mistake that he might perceive he
had fallen into. &ldquo;That I had never been in the least
backward to do this in matters of philosophy can never
be denied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though he has been considered as fond of controversy,
and that his chief delight consisted in it, yet it
was far from being true. He was more frequently the
defendant than the assailant. His controversies, as far
as it depended upon himself, were carried on with
temper and decency. He was never malicious, nor
even sarcastic or indignant, unless provoked.</p>
<p>Priestley was a very busy man and a very industrious
man, but he had not the power of sustained and concentrated
application to a single subject which is the
characteristic of men of great intellectual eminence. In
this respect he was far inferior to his contemporaries
Watt and Cavendish. His quick and active mind
enabled him rapidly to assimilate the ideas of others,
but it may be doubted, even in theology, whether he
pushed his convictions and doctrinal beliefs beyond the
limits reached by previous thinkers. His philosophy,
as Huxley has pointed out, contains little that will be
new to the readers of Hobbes, Spinoza, Collins, Hume
and Hartley. &ldquo;It does not appear,&rdquo; says his son, &ldquo;that
he spent more than six or eight hours per day in
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
business that required much mental exertion.&rdquo; In his
diary he laid down the following daily arrangements of
time for a minister&rsquo;s studies:&mdash;Studying the Scriptures,
one hour. Practical writers, half-an-hour. Philosophy
and History, two hours. Classics, half-an-hour. Composition,
one hour&mdash;in all five hours. &ldquo;All which,&rdquo; he
adds, &ldquo;may be conveniently dispatched before dinner,
which leaves the afternoon for visiting and company,
and the evening for exceeding in any article if there be
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His son tells us that for many years of his life he
never spent less than two or three hours a day in games
of amusement, as cards and backgammon, but particularly
chess, at which he and his wife played regularly
three games after dinner and as many after supper. As
his children grew up, chess was laid aside for whist or
some round game at cards, which he enjoyed as much
as any of the company. He was fond, too, of bodily
exercise, and was particularly attached to his garden, in
which he worked constantly. His laboratory also
afforded him exercise, as he never employed an
assistant, and never allowed anyone even to light his
fire.</p>
<p>The attention, he says, which he paid to the phenomena
of his own mind, made him sensible of some great
defects in its constitution. He was, he says, from
an early period, subject to a &ldquo;most humbling failure
of recollection,&rdquo; so that he sometimes lost all ideas
of both persons and things that he had been conversant
with. He says, &ldquo;I have so completely
forgotten what I have myself published, that in reading
my own writings what I find in them often appears
perfectly new to me, and I have more than once made
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
experiments the results of which had been published
by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apprised of this defect he never failed to note down
as soon as possible everything that he wished not to
forget. The same failing led him to devise and have
recourse to a variety of mechanical expedients to secure
and arrange his thoughts, which were of the greatest
use to him in the composition of large and complex
works, and what he says excited the wonder of some of
his readers would only have made them smile had they
seen him at work. &ldquo;But by simple and mechanical
methods one man shall do that in a month which shall
cost another, of equal ability, whole years to execute.
This methodical arrangement of a large work is greatly
facilitated by mechanical methods, and nothing contributes
more to the perspicuity of a large work than a
good arrangement of its parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he learned to know with respect to himself
tended much, he says, to lessen both his admiration and
his contempt of others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Could we have entered into the mind of Sir Isaac Newton,
and have traced all the steps by which he produced his great
works, we might see nothing very extraordinary in the process.
And great powers with respect to some things are generally
attended with great defects in others; and these may not
appear in a man&rsquo;s writings. For this reason, it seldom happens
but that our admiration of philosophers and writers is lessened
by a personal knowledge of them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great defects may, however, be more than counter-balanced
by great excellences, and accordingly he hopes
that his defect of recollection, possibly due to a want of
sufficient coherence in the association of ideas formerly
impressed, might arise from a mental constitution more
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
favourable to new associations, so that what he lost with
respect to memory may have been compensated by
what is called invention, or new and original combinations
of ideas.</p>
<p>In the domestic relations of life he was uniformly
kind and affectionate. As was truly said of him on
Darton&rsquo;s portrait, &ldquo;Not malice itself could ever fix a
stain on his private conduct or impeach his integrity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Birmingham riots of 1791.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The picture which Priestley drew of his life in
Birmingham at this period, as given in the autobiographical
sketch published after his death, is almost
dramatic in its pathos when we bear in mind that it was
written almost on the eve of that maniacal outburst of
popular passion which eventually drove him from our
shores. He said he considered his settlement at
Birmingham as the happiest event in his life, as being
highly favourable to every object he had in view,
philosophical or theological. He thanks God that his
prospects are better than they have ever been before,
that his own health, and that of his dear wife, is better
established, and his hopes as to the disposition and
future settlement of his children are satisfactory. He
has particular reason to be grateful for the happy
temperament of body and mind he owes to his parents,
and for the fundamentally good constitution of body to
which was due an even cheerfulness of temper which
had but few interruptions. Another great subject
of thankfulness to a good Providence was his perfect
freedom from any embarrassment in his circumstances,
for his supplies had been always equal to his
wants, and his indifference to an increase of fortune was
the means of attaining it.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PILLAGING OF PRIESTLEY&rsquo;S HOUSE DURING THE BIRMINGHAM RIOTS</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;When,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I began my experiments I expended
on them all the money I could possibly raise, carried on by
my ardour in philosophical investigations, and entirely regardless
of consequences, except so far as never to contract any
debt.... But having succeeded, I was in time more
than indemnified for all that I had expended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet frequently, as I have changed my situation, and always
for the better, I can truly say that I never wished for any
change on my own account. I should have been contented even
at Needham if I could have been unmolested and had bare
necessaries. This freedom from anxiety was remarkable in
my father, and therefore is in a manner hereditary to me; but
it has been much increased by reflection, having frequently
observed, especially with respect to Christian ministers, how
often it has contributed to embitter their lives without being of
any use to them. Some attention to the improvement of a
man&rsquo;s circumstances is no doubt right, because no man can
tell what occasion he may have for money, especially if he
have children, and therefore I do not recommend my example
to others. But I am thankful to that good Providence which
always took more care of me than ever I took of myself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This serene contentment is reflected in his correspondence
at this period, and we find further evidence
of it in the letters of his friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I esteem it a singular happiness to have lived in an age
and country in which I have been at full liberty both to
investigate, and by preaching and writing to propagate, religious
truth; that though the freedom I have used for this purpose
was for some time disadvantageous to me, it was not long so,
and that my present situation is such that I can, with the
greatest openness, urge whatever appears to me the truth of the
Gospel, not only without giving the least offence, but with the
entire approbation of those with whom I am particularly
connected.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr Aikin, visiting him in 1784, says in a letter to Mrs
Aikin:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The great philosopher, with his simple, bland, unaffected
manners, contented and happy, and declaring that he had not a
wish on earth unsatisfied, gave me infinite delight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These halcyon days were, however, but as the calm
before the storm, and the contented and happy
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
philosopher had soon need of all his philosophy, and of
all his Christianity too, in face of the ungoverned fury
of the mob which, to use Wedgwood&rsquo;s words, swept
like a hurricane over him and his friends.</p>
<p>The 14th of July 1791&mdash;the anniversary of the
French Revolution&mdash;was celebrated in several towns
in England without interruption or any untoward
circumstance; that day, however, was long remembered
by the inhabitants of Birmingham with feelings akin to
horror. It is certain that the popular rising which then
took place in that town was in the outset mainly
directed against Priestley. The course of events
proves this. As it happened, the appetite in the mob
for mischief grew by what it fed upon, and many others,
his friends and political and religious associates, were
involved in the disaster which overtook him. For it
would appear that those who, in the first instance,
instigated and directed the outrage lost all control over
the forces which they invoked, and the rising, which in
the beginning was intended to visit Priestley with the
vengeance which the Cracow mob inflicted on his
prototype Socinus, developed into a wild anarchical riot,
confused and purposeless except as gratifying a wanton
lust for rapine and destruction. Many contemporary
accounts exist of the Birmingham riots of 1791, and
although, as might be expected from the temper of the
times, some of the narratives are not wholly uncoloured
by prejudice and the partisan spirit of political and
religious feeling, it is not difficult to put together a true
view of an episode which profoundly affected all parties
and sent a thrill of apprehension and alarm throughout
the country. Political feeling at the period ran high.
Europe had recently witnessed the spectacle of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
revolution which had filled the governing classes of
every state with awe and even terror, and the great
masses of the people in this and other countries, to
whom all political power was denied, were beginning
to realise what might be possible to concerted action
properly organised and vigorously pressed. Every
bureaucracy was in a state of trepidation. The
political atmosphere was heavily charged with electricity
and no one could foretell where and when the
next thunderbolt would descend. Naturally enough
the great vested interests in Church and State looked
askance at, and were disquieted by, these periodical
celebrations of such an event as the destruction of the
Bastile and all that it symbolised, with their odes to Liberty,
Fraternity and Equality, and their impassioned appeals
to Demos, and the rising hopes of a people grown restive
and impatient under what they were taught to believe
was political thraldom. It required but a small spark
to bring about a conflagration, and designing and unscrupulous
men saw in the approaching anniversary of
the memorable 14th of July an opportunity of which
they were determined to take advantage. Priestley had
himself, unwittingly, laid the train which brought about
the catastrophe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dr Priestley,&rdquo; says Corry, writing in 1804, &ldquo;from the
commencement of his residence at Birmingham, had undoubtedly
turned his attention too much from the luminous field of
philosophic disquisition to the sterile regions of polemic
divinity and the still more thorny paths of polemic politics.
His tracts on these subjects amounted to upwards of thirty,
and from his celebrity they had a very general circulation. As
a philosopher he clearly saw defects in the most perfect of
human institutions, and expressed himself with a boldness and
freedom which alarmed the neighbouring clergy of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
Established Church, and excited their resentment. The
labouring classes in Birmingham certainly looked upon him as a
disaffected and dangerous man. Incapable of deep reflection
themselves, they abhorred his Unitarian principles as subversive
of Christianity, and the idea that the Church was in danger was
propagated among them by men of deeper discernment, who
wished to render Dr Priestley odious and unpopular. A very
considerable number, however, of the more enlightened inhabitants,
who were convinced of the Doctor&rsquo;s integrity as a
man, sincerity as a preacher, and superlative merit as a
philosopher, were his strenuous advocates and admirers. The
collision of parties became every day more violent, and the
events which were daily transacting in France kept alive the
jealousy arising from uncongenial opinions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A contemporary account states: The vigorous and
repeated attempts of the Dissenters to obtain a repeal
of the Corporation and Test Laws [repealed in 1828],
excited much alarm and apprehension amongst many of
the Established clergy, and were most forcibly felt by
those residing in Birmingham. The name and writings
of Dr Priestley were as much dreaded by his opponents
as they were admired by his friends; and as he long
resided near this town, and was eminently conspicuous
in his endeavours to procure a repeal of these laws, and
in the promulgation of Unitarian doctrines, it is not
surprising that his sentiments should have been represented
to the lower classes of the people as dangerous
to the Church and State.</p>
<p>Attacks made upon his principles and motives in
different pulpits were answered from the Press, and
produced among other things his <i>Familiar Letters
Addressed to the Inhabitants of Birmingham</i>, in which his
opponents are combated with much force and severity.
In the course of his controversial publications Priestley
had made a comparison of the progress of free inquiry
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
to the action of gunpowder. The conclusion of the
passage ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The present silent propagation of truth may even be
compared to those causes in Nature which lie dormant for a
time, but which in proper circumstances act with the greatest
violence. We are, as it were, laying gunpowder, grain by
grain, under the old building of error and superstition, which a
single spark may hereafter inflame, so as to produce an
instantaneous explosion; in consequence of which that edifice,
the erection of which has been the work of ages, may be overturned
in a moment, and so effectually as that the same
foundation can never be built upon again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph became to the enemies of the Dissenters
a common topic of allusion, and was read in the
House of Commons as an unquestionable proof of the
dangerous designs of that body with respect to the
constitution of this country. Hence the mischievous
thinkers found no difficulty in persuading the unthinking
actors that the real intentions of the Dissenters were
to destroy the churches.</p>
<p>That mischief was being deliberately planned in view
of the coming anniversary was certainly known to not a
few of those in authority, some of whom from their
position were responsible for the order and good
government of the town. Some days before the outbreak
a number of copies of a seditious hand-bill had
been left in a public-house by an unknown person, and
this had been copied and circulated throughout the
town, causing a general ferment in the minds of the
lowest class of the people. Its character was such that
the magistrates promptly offered a reward of one hundred
guineas for the discovery of the Writer, Printer,
Publisher or Distributer of the inflammatory hand-bill.
But notwithstanding that the Dissenters themselves
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
afterwards offered an additional reward of one hundred
guineas, and the Government also proclaimed a further
reward of one hundred pounds, no clue was ever
obtained to the persons concerned in its preparation or
distribution. Such, however, was the feeling of apprehension
in the minds of those who were about to take
part in the proposed celebration that it was determined
to publish the following advertisement in the <i>Birmingham
Chronicle</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="tbcenter"><span class="sc">Birmingham Commemoration of the French Revolution.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Several hand-bills having been circulated in the town which
can only be intended to create distrust concerning the intention
of the meeting, to disturb its harmony and inflame the minds
of people, the Gentlemen who proposed it think it necessary to
declare their entire disapprobation of all such hand-bills and
their ignorance of the authors. Sensible themselves of the
advantages of a Free Government, they rejoice in the extension
of Liberty to their Neighbours, at the same time
avowing, in the most explicit manner, their firm attachment
to the Constitution of their own Country, as vested in the
Three Estates of the King, Lords and Commons. Surely no
<i>Free-born Englishman</i> can refrain from exulting in this addition
to the general mass of human happiness. It is the cause of
<i>Humanity</i>, it is the cause of the People.</p>
<p><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Birmingham</span>, <i>July 13, 1791</i>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We learn from a letter in the same newspaper, written
a few days later by Mr William Russell, Priestley&rsquo;s
friend, and himself, with his family, a sufferer in the
events which followed, that in spite of this disclaimer
there was still good grounds for believing that evil
was brewing. He says that on the morning of the 14th
many rumours of the probability of a riot were brought
to the friends of the meeting; and as there was too
much reason to think that means had been used to promote
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
one, they determined to postpone the intended
dinner and prepared a notice to that effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says Mr Russell, &ldquo;was sent to the printer, but
before he had composed it, Mr Dadley, the master of the
hotel, attended, in consequence of having the Dinner countermanded,
and represented that he was sure there was no danger
of any tumult, and recommended that the Dinner might be held
as was intended; only proposing that the gentlemen should take
care to break up early, and then all danger would be avoided.
This measure was then adopted, and orders given to the printer
to suppress the hand-bill. Accordingly there was a meeting of
eighty-one gentlemen, inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood,
at the great room in the hotel, where they dined and
passed the afternoon with that social, temperate and benevolent
festivity which the consideration of the great event that has
diffused liberty and happiness among a large portion of the
human race inspired.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Russell continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is but justice to the liberality and public spirit of an
inglorious artist of this town to mention that he decorated
the room upon this occasion with three elegant emblematic
pieces of sculpture, mixed with painting, in a new style of
composition. The central piece was a finely executed
medallion of His Majesty, encircled with a Glory, on each
side of which was an alabaster Obelisk; one exhibiting Gallic
Liberty breaking the bands of Despotism, and the other representing
British Liberty in its present enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A truly respectable gentleman [Captain Keir], a member of
the Church of England, was chairman; others of that profession
were of the company, nor was a single sentiment uttered, or, I
believe, conceived, that would hurt the feelings of any one friend
to liberty and good government under the happy constitution we
are blessed with in this kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mob, if they thought at all, thought otherwise.
Although, we are told, the utmost harmony prevailed
at the festive board, and the company dispersed without
the least disturbance, they found a considerable number
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
of the populace assembled in the neighbourhood of
Temple Row, evidently bent on mischief. The crowd
remained in the vicinity of the hotel, their numbers
gradually increasing, for a couple of hours after Captain
Keir and his friends had left. Whether the people
expected Priestley to be of the company, and fancied he
was being detained in the hotel on account of their
threatening attitude, is uncertain. As a matter of fact
he had not been at the dinner. Suddenly the cry of
&ldquo;Church and King!&rdquo; was raised, and at that signal
every window in the front of the hotel was promptly
broken. Thereupon, as if by a common impulse, or if
as acting under direction, the crowd swept onwards to
the New Meeting, where Priestley preached; this they
assailed, we are told, with incredible fury. The New
Meeting was erected in 1730: it was described as a
considerable pile, &ldquo;more remarkable for plainness and
simplicity than for any uncommon elegance of workmanship
or superb style of decoration. The vestry contained
a valuable collection of books for the use of the
Society which assembled there.&rdquo; The gates and doors
were soon burst open, the pews demolished, the cushions
and fragments carried out and burnt in front of the
building, and at length fire was carried in which
consumed it to the outer walls. The mob was now
roused to frenzy. Some of the magistrates strove to
quell the riot, and even those who had connived at the
outrage grew alarmed at the dangerous temper which
they had roused. But the infuriated rabble by this time
was thoroughly out of control, and no sufficient force
was at hand to cope with it. The Old Meeting-House
was next demolished with the regularity of workmen
employed for the purpose. A party armed with crow-bars,
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
bludgeons, etc., tore down the pulpit, pews and
galleries, and burnt them in the burying-ground, afterwards
setting fire to the body of the Meeting-house.
The cry of &ldquo;Church and King!&rdquo; was again raised, and the
rioters marched in a body to Fair Hill, about a mile
from the town, where Priestley resided. His house was
described by Aikin as &ldquo;a most comfortable and pleasing
retreat.&rdquo; &ldquo;Although,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;it belonged to a
gentleman who was deservedly a favourite of the poor,
yet because it was the dwelling of Dr Priestley it was
doomed to destruction,&rdquo; and was &ldquo;attacked with the
most savage and determined fury.&rdquo; Priestley, when the
news was brought to him by his friend, Samuel
Ryland, of the destruction of the Meeting-Houses and
of the impending attack on Fair Hill, was playing backgammon
with his wife, as was his custom after supper.
He could hardly be persuaded of the danger in which
he stood, and it was with difficulty that Ryland hurried
him and Mrs Priestley into the chaise which was waiting
at the door. He and his wife were then quickly driven to
Showell Green, the residence of his friend, William
Russell, leaving his son William Priestley, and some
other young persons, with the servants to protect the
property. What followed may best be gleaned from
the graphic narrative of Miss Martha Russell, written
within a few days of the occurrence, but first published
in <i>The Christian Reformer</i> of 1835, Vol. II. p. 293:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As we were at supper, Tolley, our footman, came in with a
countenance as pale as ashes, and told my father a messenger
was just arrived to inform him that a mob had collected and
set fire to the New Meeting-House, and were then employed in
destroying the Old Meeting-House also, and they declared
their intention to come from thence to Dr Priestley&rsquo;s house
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
and then to ours, and that no magistrate appeared or could be
found to disperse them. Consternation and alarm now filled
our minds. My father ordered his horse, intending to go and
meet the mob, and search out the justices to quell it. Whilst
he was loading his pocket-pistols to carry with him, a chaise
drove up to the door with Dr and Mrs Priestley and Mr
Samuel Ryland. The latter had taken the alarm, and, procuring
a chaise, had hurried the Doctor and Mrs P. away from
their house, fearing the mob would be there immediately. So
great was the panic he had felt and inspired them with that
they had secured nothing, but seemed as if happy and fortunate
in escaping with their lives. We all united in begging my
father not to leave the house, and urged the danger he would
be in by meeting such an ungovernable concourse of people,
and that, being alone, he could do nothing towards quelling
them, and no doubt but our friends in Birmingham would
some of them exert themselves and stir up the magistrates
without his running such a risk. He would, however, hear
nothing of it, but declared &lsquo;he would be his own master that
night.&rsquo; Seeing him resolved to go, Mrs Priestley requested
him to bring her a small box of money she had in her chamber,
and Dr P. wished for his pocket-book, which contained something
of value, and which he had left on the table in the
parlour, so great was their hurry and alarm.... We walked
up and down the foot-road leading to town in a dreadful state of
suspense and apprehension, clearly discerning the fire from the
two Meeting-Houses, and distinctly hearing the shouts of the
mob....</p>
<p>&ldquo;In about three hours my father returned and informed us he
went first to Dr Priestley&rsquo;s house, where he found William
Priestley, whom he instructed to begin and move all the
Doctor&rsquo;s manuscripts he thought most likely to be valuable, by
means of persons in the neighbourhood whom my father had
brought for that purpose, and on whom he could rely, to a
place in the vicinity he had fixed upon as secret and secure.
This he urged him to do as expeditiously and quietly as
possible, and to continue this employ, including also any other
valuables he recollected, till my father should send him word
to stop, not attending to any reports that might be brought him.
My father then rode on to town as far as Digbeth, and there
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
meeting the mob, he tried in vain to proceed. He met many
of his friends, all of whom requested him to return, telling him
he did not hear the threats that were uttered against him. At
length, one of them, I believe Mr J. F&mdash;&mdash;, suddenly turned
his horse, and giving him a cut with his whip, the press was so
great and the spirit of the horse so roused my father found
himself obliged in a manner to return. Arriving at Dr
Priestley&rsquo;s gate before the mob, he stationed himself withinside
till the mob came up, and then addressed them, endeavouring
to induce them, by fair words and money, to desist and
return home. At first they seemed a little pacified and
inclined to listen, till one more loud than the rest, and who had
the appearance of a ringleader, cried out, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t take a
sixpence of his money: in the riots of &rsquo;80 in London a man
was hanged for only taking sixpence.&rsquo; They all then
vociferated, &lsquo;Stone him, stone him!&rsquo; and began to fling stones.
My father then, finding it rashness to brave two or three
thousand men, turned his horse and rode up to the house,
telling William Priestley that he must desist and take as much
care of the house as he could, and advising him to make all
the doors and windows as secure as possible. He then rode
off home and informed us he did not think our house yet in
danger, but thought we had better remove with Dr and Mrs
P. to Mr Thomas Hawkes, about half a mile off, for fear we
should be suddenly surprised. During this time several
messages were sent, and friends came to warn us of our danger.
All seemed to apprehend the mob would visit us, and we had
been advised to set out a barrel of ale on the lawn, thus
attempting to pacify them and persuade them to desist. This
done, and proper persons left to watch, we all walked up to
Mr Hawkes&rsquo;s. Here we found the family up and under great
apprehension; and here we soon heard the shouts of the mob
at Dr Priestley&rsquo;s house (and I shall never forget what dreadful
and hideous shouts they were), intermingled with a loud noise
of battering against the walls, and such a confusion of cries,
huzzas, etc., as cannot be imagined. Soon the flames burst
forth, and then all seemed quiet. What were the emotions of
our minds at this moment no one can imagine unless they had
beheld our countenances and heard the broken, short sentences
that formed all the conversation which passed amongst us: yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
the extreme agitation of our minds did not prevent us from
admiring the divine appearance of the excellent Dr Priestley.
No human being could, in my opinion, appear in any trial
more like divine, or show a nearer resemblance to our Saviour,
than he did then. Undaunted he heard the blows which were
destroying the house and laboratory that contained all his
valuable and rare apparatus and their effects, which it had
been the business of his life to collect and use. All this
apparatus, together with the uses he had made of them, the
laborious exertions of his whole life, were being destroyed by a
set of merciless, ignorant, lawless banditti, whilst he, tranquil
and serene, walked up and down the road with a firm yet
gentle pace that evinced his entire self-possession, and a
complete self-satisfaction and consciousness which rendered
him thus firm and resigned under the unjust and cruel persecution
of his enemies; and with a countenance expressing the
highest devotion, turned as it were from this scene and fixed with
pure and calm resignation on him who suffered the administration
of this bitter cup. Not one hasty or impatient expression, not
one look expressive of murmur or complaint, not one tear or
sigh escaped him; resignation and a conscious innocence and
virtue seemed to subdue all these feelings of humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four o&rsquo;clock my father returned and informed us that
as the fire had consumed the doctor&rsquo;s house the mob were
nearly dispersed, half drunk, having been up to their ankles
in wine in his cellar, where they had broke the necks off all
the bottles and inundated the cellar with that portion of their
contents they could not drink; that the fields round were
now covered with these fiends sleeping from drunkenness and
fatigue, and that as day was now come he thought it most
likely they would disperse entirely, and that consequently we
might return home again. Accordingly we set off, and never
shall I forget the joy with which I entered our own gates once
more.... A room was prepared for the Doctor and
Mrs P. We all looked and felt our gratitude; but the Doctor
appeared the happiest amongst us. Just as he was going to
rest, expressing his thankfulness in being permitted to lie down
again in peace and comfort, my father returned from Fair Hill
with the intelligence that they were collecting again, and their
threats were more violent than ever, that they swore to find
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
Dr P. and take his life. The chaise was now ordered with all
speed, and instead of the much-desired rest the Doctor and
Mrs P. were obliged to dress again and get into it, scarcely
knowing whither to go. Mr Ryland accompanied them, and
it was thought most advisable to take a by-road to Heath,
where Mrs Finch, the Doctor&rsquo;s daughter, lived, near Dudley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He remained at Heath Forge,&rdquo; says another account,
&ldquo;until Saturday, July 16th, meanwhile writing to Lindsey and
to his sister, Mrs Crouch, then living at Gildersome, fearing
that she would receive false accounts through the newspapers.
On the afternoon of that day he set off on horseback, with a
servant, for Worcester, intending to catch the London mail
that evening. But the fugitives lost their way on the Morfe,
a common between Heath Forge and Bridgenorth, and wandered
about all night. They, however, reached Kidderminster
safely in the morning, and were met by Mr Ryland,
who offered Priestley his own wig and coat by way of disguise.
But the doctor declined. He had on a coat buttoned up to
the chin, a wig and a cocked hat, with the point in front, his
usual dress out of doors. Mr Ryland accompanied Priestley
as far as Worcester, and arrived just in time to take a place for
him in the mail to London. He travelled all night, reaching
London between six and seven in the morning of Monday, July
18th, and went to his friend Lindsey&rsquo;s in Essex Street, Strand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Russell&rsquo;s apprehensions proved to be only too
well-founded. Showell Green was destroyed, as were
Bordesley Hall and Moseley Hall, and other houses in
the vicinity of Moseley; Mr Ryland&rsquo;s house at Easy
Hill, and Mr Hutton&rsquo;s house in High Street and his
country seat at Wash Wood Heath.</p>
<p>On Sunday the rioters proceeded to King&rsquo;s Wood,
seven miles from Birmingham, and destroyed the
meeting-house and the dwelling of the Dissenting
minister. For the greater part of three days the town
was in a state of siege, the majority of the shops were
closed and business was at a stand-still. Attempts
were made to organise a force of constables, but the
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
number got together was insufficient to cope with the
mob, and in an effort to protect Mr Ryland&rsquo;s house the
police were beaten after a severe contest, and many
were wounded. A number of the rioters lost their
lives; one man was killed by the fall of a coping stone
from Priestley&rsquo;s house and a number were wounded.
At Easy Hill the drunken wretches in the cellars were
overwhelmed by the falling in of the flaming roof, six
were got out alive, but terribly burnt and bruised,
whilst ten dead bodies were dug out of the ruins.</p>
<p>Late on Sunday night three troops of dragoons
reached the town:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Their arrival,&rdquo; says a contemporary chronicler, &ldquo;was
announced by the sound of their trumpets and the acclamations
of the inhabitants. Anxiety, which had been strongly
depicted in every face during the day, was succeeded by the
smiles of joy and the congratulations of neighbours. The town
was illuminated, the rioters, conscious of their delinquency,
soon dispersed, and order was happily restored without
bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The King, writing to Mr Secretary Dundas in approval
of dragoons having been sent to Birmingham to quell
the tumult, thus continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Though I cannot but feel better pleased that Priestley is
the sufferer for the doctrines he and his party have instilled,
and that the people see them in their true light, yet I cannot
approve of their having employed such atrocious means of
showing their discontent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Mr Lindsey&rsquo;s house Priestley sent the following
letter to the <i>Birmingham Chronicle</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="tbcenter">&ldquo;<span class="sc">To the Inhabitants of the Town of Birmingham.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">My late Townsmen and Neighbours</span>,&mdash;After living
with you eleven years, in which you had uniform experience
of my peaceful behaviour, in my attention to the quiet studies
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
of my profession and those of philosophy, I was far from
expecting the injuries which I and my friends have lately
received from you. But you have been misled. By hearing
the Dissenters, and particularly the Unitarian Dissenters,
continually railed at, as enemies to the present government
in Church and State, you have been led to consider any
injury done to us as a meritorious thing, and, not having been
better informed, the means were not attended to. When the
<i>object</i> was right you thought the <i>means</i> could not be wrong.
By the discourses of your teachers, and the exclamations of
your superiors in general, drinking confusion and damnation to
us (which is well known to have been their frequent practice),
your bigotry has been excited to the highest pitch, and nothing
has been said to you to moderate your passions, but everything
to inflame them; hence, without any consideration on your
part or on theirs, who ought to have known and taught you
better, you were prepared for every species of outrage, thinking
that whatever you could do to spite and injure us was for the
support of Government, and especially the Church. In <i>destroying
us</i> you have been led to think <i>you did God</i> and your country
the most substantial <i>service</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happily the minds of Englishmen have a horror of <i>murder</i>,
and therefore you did not, I hope, think of <i>that</i>, though by your
clamorous demanding of <i>me</i> at the hotel it is probable that at
that time some of you intended me some personal injury. But
what is the value of life when everything is done to make it
wretched? In many cases there would be greater mercy in
dispatching the inhabitants than in burning their houses. However,
I infinitely prefer what I feel from <i>the spoiling of my goods</i>
to the disposition of those who have misled you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have destroyed the most truly valuable and useful
apparatus of philosophical instruments that perhaps any individual
in this or any other country was ever possessed of, in
my use of which I annually spent large sums, with no pecuniary
view whatever, but only in the advancement of science, for
the benefit of my country and of mankind. You have destroyed
a library corresponding to that apparatus which no money can
re-purchase, except in a course of time. But what I feel
far more, you have destroyed <i>manuscripts</i>, which have been
the result of the laborious study of many years, and which I
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
shall never be able to recompose; and this has been done to one
who never did, or imagined you, any harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing more of the <i>hand-bill</i>, which is said to have
enraged you so much, than any of yourselves, and I disapprove
of it as much, though it has been made the ostensible handle
of doing infinitely more mischief than anything of that nature
could possibly have done. In the celebration of the French
Revolution, at which I did not attend, the company assembled
on the occasion only expressed their joy in the emancipation of
a neighbouring nation from tyranny, without intimating a desire
of anything more than such an improvement of our own Constitution,
as all sober citizens, of every persuasion, have long
wished for. And though, in answer to the gross and unprovoked
calumnies of Mr Madan and others, I publicly vindicated
my principles as a Dissenter, it was only with plain and
sober argument, and with perfect good-humour. We are better
instructed in the mild and forbearing spirit of Christianity
than ever to think of having recourse to <i>violence</i>; and can
you think such conduct as yours any recommendation of your
religious principles in preference to ours?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still more mistaken if you imagine that this conduct
of yours has any tendency to serve your cause or to injure ours.
It is nothing but <i>reason</i> and <i>argument</i> that can ever support any
system of religion. Answer your arguments and your business
is done; but your having recourse to <i>violence</i> is only a proof
that you have nothing better to produce. Should you destroy
myself, as well as my house, library and apparatus, ten more
persons of equal or superior spirit and ability would instantly
rise up. If these ten were destroyed one hundred would appear;
and believe me, that the Church of England, which you now
think you are supporting, has received a greater blow by this
conduct of yours than I and all my friends have ever aimed
at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, to abuse those who have no power of making
resistance is equally cowardly and brutal, peculiarly unworthy
of Englishmen, to say nothing of Christianity, which teaches
us to do as we would be done by. In this business we are the
sheep and you are the wolves. We will preserve our character,
and hope you will change yours. At all events, we
return you blessings for curses, and pray that you may soon
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
return to that industry and the sober manners for which the
inhabitants of Birmingham were formerly distinguished.&mdash;I am,
your sincere well-wisher,
<span class="lr"><span class="sc">J. Priestley</span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="small">&ldquo;<span class="sc">London</span>, <i>July 19, 1791</i>.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;The account of the first toast at the Revolution
Dinner in the <i>Times</i> of this morning can be nothing less than
a malicious lie. To prove this a list of the toasts, with an
account of all the proceedings of the day, will soon be
published. The first of these was <i>The King and Constitution</i>,
and they were all such as the friends of liberty, and of the
true principles of the Constitution, would approve.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the earliest letters of sympathy he received
was from his steadfast friend and benefactor, Wedgwood.
It was written from Weymouth, at that time the most
fashionable seaside watering-place in England, and
condoled with him on the &ldquo;irreparable loss&rdquo; he had
&ldquo;sustain&rsquo;d from the brutality, or rather let us hope the
temporary insanity&rdquo; of his neighbours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If they had arisen merely from the ungovern&rsquo;d madness of
a mob from the lowest order of our species, one would then
lament all its effects like those of a storm or hurricane, but if
there is reason to believe that the rabble were acted upon and
encouraged to such proceedings by those who should be their
superiors, one cannot but perceive the too evident spirit of the
times, or of the place at least, by which you and so many of
your worthy neighbours have suffered.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wedgwood then earnestly begs his friend to let him
know how he can be of service to him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Instruct me in the means of doing it and I shall esteem it
as one of the strongest instances of your friendship.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s reply was written from the house of his
son-in-law, William Finch, Heath Forge, Birmingham,
and was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your very kind and sympathising letter was very acceptable
to me. The shock was no doubt very great, but I thank God I
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
have been able to bear it without any loss of health, or, indeed,
of spirits. I begin to suffer most from want of employment
and absence from my family, which indeed is irksome to me.
My wife behaved with the greatest heroism at the time, but
continuing in the neighbourhood, and hearing continually of
the bad spirit that prevails in the place, I perceived that her
mind began to be affected by it. She cannot remove, as my
daughter expects to be brought to bed in about a month, and
she cannot bear that her mother should be absent at the time.
This circumstance adds much to my difficulty. Could we go
together to some distant place for a month we should be much
more comfortable. One good thing has already come out of
this evil&mdash;I have a kind letter from Mr John Wilkinson inviting
us to any house of his, and bidding me not to regard any
losses that money can repair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His brother-in-law promptly sent him &pound;500 after the
riots, and subsequently transferred to him &pound;10,000 in
the French funds. As these were afterwards nonproductive
he afterwards gave him an annuity of &pound;200.</p>
<p>Immediately after the riots he received a great number
of addresses and testimonials from his theological and
philosophical admirers, and an address transmitted by
Condorcet was sent to him from the French Academy
of Sciences.</p>
<p>One of the earliest letters he dispatched from London
was to Keir, under date July 22, 1791.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="tbcenter"><span class="sc">Priestley to Keir.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very happy to see a copy of your letter to the printer
of the <i>Birmingham Chronicle</i>, and in return enclose copies of
my &lsquo;Address to the Inhabitants of Birmingham,&rsquo; and of
Mr Russell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Account of the Proceedings on July 14th.&rsquo;
Both these have been in the London papers and I have just
sent yours to the printer of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happy to hear that all is quiet with you now, but when
it will be proper for me to come to you I cannot tell. I fear
not before the next Lunar Society. Whether I shall ever
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
have it in my power to collect another apparatus for experiments
is quite uncertain, as indeed is, in a great measure, my settling
again at Birmingham, though there is no place in the world
that I should prefer to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The extra copies of my last paper for the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> are printed, and I shall soon send some to Mr
Galton to be presented to each of the members of the Lunar
Society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg my compliments to them, and as long as I live I shall
with much satisfaction think of our many happy meetings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a letter to Wedgwood, dated four days later, he
sends two copies of his paper, and says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I shall not soon be able to furnish materials for
another. Indeed, what I shall do, or where I shall settle, is
uncertain. I shall, however, continue at Birmingham <i>if possible</i>,
and resume all my pursuits, in which case I must thank you
for a fresh stock of <i>retorts</i>, tubes, etc., etc., etc. This invasion
of the Goths and Vandals I little foresaw, and hope it will
never be repeated, as I fancy the <i>experiment</i> will not be found
to answer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next letter to Keir, dated July 29, 1791, is
interesting as throwing further light upon the causes of
the riots:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of returning to Birmingham till my
friends there should think it safe and, on their accounts,
advisable; and this, I now begin to fear, will not be so soon
as you intimate. However, I am ready to attend the first
summons, and earnestly wish it may be before the next Lunar
Society. But your meeting must not depend upon this
event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this I send each of you a copy of my late, and I fear
<i>last</i>, paper for the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>. I shall always
recollect, with peculiar satisfaction and regret, our many
cheerful and improving meetings; and if not a constant, shall
indulge the hope of being an occasional, attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were certainly a better judge than I was of the <i>spirit of
the times</i>. But even you could not have expected such brutal
excesses as have taken place; and yet I am willing to hope
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
much from <i>time</i>, from your seasonable letter, and the representations
of the more calm and reasonable members of the Church
of England, if not from the interposition of Government and
the execution of the laws, in which I <i>wish</i> for moderation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lately dined with Mr Sheridan, who said I should meet
Mr Fox.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> He, however, was prevented from attending, but
desired Mr Sheridan to say that he wished to take the matter
up in whatever manner we should think proper, by motion in
the House on the subject. They conceive that the encouragement
given to this High Church spirit by the Court
arises from their willingness to crush Mr Fox, who has taken
our part, and that they hoped by these measures to intimidate
us into silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I can hardly think to be the case, and I am unwilling
to connect our cause with that of any political party; since
upon the face of it, as you have clearly shown, it is wholly of
a religious nature. However, I said there would be time
enough to take our measures before the next meeting of
Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr Withering, himself a sufferer, hastened to express
his sympathy. Priestley replied to his letters as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your generous contribution towards the re-establishment of
my philosophical apparatus cannot but give me satisfaction,
though I am sorry to be so burdensome to my friends, especially
my fellow-sufferers, among whom you are ranked. But what the
country will do towards indemnifying us appears very distant
and uncertain, and my claims will be liable to the greatest uncertainty,
as the <i>proof</i> that may be required of my losses cannot
be given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happy to find that your alarms and sufferings have no
more affected your spirit and health than my own did mine, and
that we may so soon expect your third volume.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a considerable time, with every assistance that
money can afford, before I can be at work again, and hardly
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
ever to so much advantage as at Birmingham. Such assistance
from philosophical friends I should in vain look for here, and
as long as I live I shall look back with pleasure and regret to
our Lunar meetings, which I always enjoyed so much and
from which I derived so much solid advantage. If I could
find the same <i>intelligence</i> in any club of Philosophers here, I
could not find the same <i>frankness</i> which is the charm of all
society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nearly printed <i>An Appeal to the Public</i> on the subject
of the late riot, and shall direct the printer to deliver you a copy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sensible that it will more exasperate my enemies, but
it is addressed to our common judges, and may conciliate <i>them</i>,
at least in a course of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lately written to Mr Watt, and desired him, or the
Lunar Society as a body, to make a proposal to those who act
for the country. I hope you will see the propriety of it and
contribute to its effect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Appeal</i> evidently cost Priestley much pains in
its composition. Part of it was sent in sheets to his
intimate friends in Birmingham, notably Dr Withering,
Mr Galton and Mr Russell, who conferred together and
with Captain Keir as to the advisability of publishing it.
Like him they were sensible that it would certainly more
exasperate his enemies. Captain Keir endeavoured to
dissuade him from its publication, at least in its proposed
form, saying that it would &ldquo;irritate his professed
enemies, and furnish them with a new source of abuse,&rdquo;
and that he feared that &ldquo;Government would become
more remiss in prosecuting the magistrates and in protecting
the Dissenters in future if they should meet with
any passage that would give them offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On learning the opinion of his friends Priestley wrote
to Wedgwood:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have desired the printer to send you a copy of my <i>Appeal</i>
on the subject of the riots, in order to have your opinion and
advice with respect to publishing of it. Several of my friends
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
in Birmingham, viz., Dr Withering, Mr Keir and Mr Galton,
think that it had better be suppressed, or published with many
alterations by way of softening. Others, and especially my
friends here, are for its speedy publication, or about the time of
the meeting of Parliament. In this state of suspense I beg your
perusal of it and your free opinion. I think that if I write at
all it should not be with less spirit than I have usually shown,
and that there is nothing more violent or offensive in <i>this</i> than
in several of my preaching publications. But as others are
interested in the event of this publication I am willing to be
advised by them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 24, 1791, at the Warwick Assizes, John
Green, John Clifton and Bartholomew Fisher were
indicted for that they, with one William Jones, at large,
with others, to the number of fifty and more, did, on the
15th of July, unlawfully and riotously assemble and
with force of arms begin to pull down the dwelling-house
of Joseph Priestley, LL.D. The jury found
Green and Fisher guilty and Clifton not guilty.</p>
<p>John Stokes, for beginning to pull down the Old
Meeting-House in Birmingham, was acquitted, on account
of the defects in the indictment. The following was
Baron Perryn&rsquo;s sentence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners, you have been convicted by very human and
attentive juries of the enormous crimes of setting fire to and
destroying the houses and property of your fellow-subjects in a
manner as wanton as it was unprovoked. Your cry of &lsquo;Church
and King!&rsquo; was nothing but a pretext to commit depredation
and robbery. The Law and Constitution is a sufficient shield
to protect the Church and the sacred person of His Majesty
and all his good subjects in their lives and property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time the Law possesses sufficient energy and
vigour to make examples of those bad citizens who wickedly
and wantonly violate it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, miserable criminals, are of that number, and it is necessary
that your lives should atone for your crimes, as a public example.
You must therefore be removed from this world; and I most
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
earnestly recommend you to employ the short space of time
which will be allowed to you to make your peace with your
offended Creator, who alone can grant that mercy which you
must not expect from your country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s own account of these proceedings, as given
in his <i>Memoirs</i>, is very na&iuml;ve and even studiously dispassionate.
He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;About two years before I left Birmingham, the question
about the &lsquo;Test Act&rsquo; was much agitated both in and out
of Parliament. This, however, was altogether without any
concurrence of mine. I only delivered, and published, a sermon
on the 5th of November 1789, recommending the most peaceable
method of pursuing our object. Mr Madan, however, the
most respectable clergyman in the town, preaching and publishing
a very inflammatory sermon on the subject, inveighing in the
bitterest manner against the Dissenters in general and myself
in particular, I addressed a number of &lsquo;Familiar Letters to the
Inhabitants of Birmingham&rsquo; in our defence. This produced
a reply from him and other letters from me. All mine were
written in an ironical and rather a pleasant manner, and in some
of the last of them I introduced a further reply to Mr Burn,
another clergyman in Birmingham, who had addressed to me
&lsquo;Letters on the Infallibility of the Testimony of the Apostles
concerning the Person of Christ,&rsquo; after replying to his first
set of letters, in a separate publication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From these small pieces I was far from expecting any serious
consequences. But the Dissenters in general being very
obnoxious to the Court, and it being imagined, though without
any reason, that I had been the chief promoter of the measures
which gave them offence, the clergy, not only in Birmingham
but through all England, seemed to make it their business, by
writing in the public papers, by preaching and other methods,
to inflame the minds of the people against me. And on
occasion of the celebration of the anniversary of the French
Revolution, on July 14, 1791, by several of my friends, but
with which I had little to do, a mob, encouraged by some
persons in power, first burned the meeting-house in which I
preached, then another meeting-house in the town, and then my
dwelling-house, demolishing my library, apparatus and, as far
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
as they could, everything belonging to me. They also burned,
or much damaged, the houses of many Dissenters, chiefly my
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The criminality of the magistrates and other principal
High Churchmen at Birmingham in promoting the riot remains
acknowledged. Indeed, many circumstances which have
appeared since that time show that the friends of the Court, if
not the Prime Ministers themselves, were the favourers of that
riot, having, no doubt, thought to intimidate the friends of
liberty by the measure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The years following the riot of 1791,&rdquo; wrote Mr
Matthew Devonport Hill, &ldquo;witnessed various displays
of hostile sentiment. In preparation for a municipal
dinner shortly after that event, of which a member of
the powerful and wealthy party opposed to French
principles bore the cost, the list of guests accustomed
prior to the outbreak to be invited on public occasions
had been sedulously cleared of adverse elements. By
inadvertence, however, the name of Dr Parr was retained;
and the sturdy divine, although he must have
surmised that he would be the only representative of his
opinions, duly obeyed the summons. The cloth being
drawn, the Chairman proposed, as the Doctor no doubt
expected, the toast of &lsquo;Church and King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parr instantly started to his feet, proclaiming in a
stern voice his dissent. &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I will not
drink that toast. It was the cry of Jacobites; it is
the cry of incendiaries. It means a Church without the
Gospel, and a King above the Law!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Determines to leave England&mdash;His arrival in America&mdash;Settles
at Northumberland&mdash;His closing days&mdash;His
death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s position in London for some time after his
arrival there was very insecure, and so apprehensive
were his friends of further outrage that it was thought
necessary to provide him with a disguise and to arrange
a plan of escape in case the house should be attacked.
At first he was not allowed to appear in the streets.
Ultimately he was moved to Tottenham, where he spent
a month.</p>
<p>In the middle of October a house was taken for him
in Hackney, but it was with difficulty that the landlord,
who feared his property would be demolished, was
persuaded to accept him as a tenant. Here, however,
he proceeded to build himself a laboratory, and in a
letter to Thomas Wedgwood, of October 18, 1791, he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as convenient I shall be obliged to your father if he
will supply me, as usual, with such retorts as you make, viz.,
earthen tubes closed at the end and open, and some with two
necks. Small <i>retorts</i>, <i>evaporating-dishes</i>, <i>mortars</i> and <i>levigators</i>.
Perhaps your servants here can tell me the price at which I
must estimate those that were destroyed by the riot. I must
soon give in an account of my losses, and I fear that some
person on your part must attend at Warwick to attest the
value. Mr Nairn, Mr Parker and others have promised to
attend. But I have prepared [proposed] a conference between
my appraiser and those for the county in London, which, if
they be disposed to do justice, will save much trouble and
expense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whether I shall be invited to succeed Dr Price is uncertain.
Many apprehend public disturbance in consequence of my
coming. I could not get a house let in my own name. A
friend took it in his. I have, however, very handsome
proposals from France, particularly the offer of a house
completely furnished, two miles from Paris, and another polite
invitation from Toulouse, to take up my residence in the South
of France in &lsquo;a monastery which reason has recovered from
superstition.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s claim for damages amounted to &pound;3628,
8s. 9d. Hutton says his real loss was upwards of
&pound;4500 (Jewitt&rsquo;s <i>Life of Hutton</i>, p. 255). The Court
allowed &pound;2502, 18s. In the town of Birmingham
property to the value of &pound;50,000 was destroyed, of
which sum &pound;26,961, 2s. 3d. was finally paid by a rate
on the Hundred, in which Birmingham is included (Sam
Timmins, <i>Trans. Midl. Inst.</i>, 1875).</p>
<p>Lindsey, writing to his friend, Alexander of Yarmouth,
under date October 15, 1791, mentioning Priestley,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He is very well, and with his wonted cheerfulness, which
has never forsaken him. Sunday last he preached for me for
the first time since he has been expelled by fire and destruction
out of his own place of worship, and he does me that favour
to-morrow again. He has at last, though very reluctantly,
and much to the concern of his late beloved people, given up
the thought of continuing the pastoral office among them, as
the exercise of it would not probably be consistent with his
personal safety and liberty; such is the temper of his many
adversaries still, and so hostile to him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The managers of other Dissenting chapels had not
the courage of Lindsey and begged that he would
refrain from preaching to their congregations. Eventually
he was invited to take the position formerly
occupied by his friend Price.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>The rancour of his enemies now broke out afresh,
and the most persistent efforts were made to damage
and disparage him in the eyes of his congregation. His
friends in the neighbourhood were advised to move
their effects to some place of greater safety, as it was
common rumour that his house was to be attacked on
the succeeding anniversary of the Birmingham riot. His
servants were afraid to remain for any length of time
with him, and the tradespeople hesitated to take his
custom. He was several times burnt in effigy along
with Tom Paine. Coloured caricatures of him, of the
grossest and coarsest kind, in which he was described
as &ldquo;the treacherous rebel and Birmingham rioter&rdquo; were
scattered broadcast. Insulting letters, in some of which
he was likened to Guy Fawkes or the devil himself,
were sent to him from all parts of the country, even
from men calling themselves ministers of the Gospel.
In one of these he was threatened with being burned
alive before a slow fire. The Rev. Dr Tatham, Rector
of Lincoln College, Oxford, whose biographer compared
him with Warburton (&ldquo;There is much of the
same rough, unpolished strength in his language&rdquo;), thus
addressed him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Long have you been the Danger of this country, the
Bane of its Polity, and the Canker-worm of its Happiness.
Long, too long, have your Principles tended to bereave it of
its Religion, its Constitution, and consequently of its King.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burke, to his everlasting shame, inveighed against
him in the House of Commons, and many of his
associates in the Royal Society shunned him.</p>
<p>His position in the Society became eventually so
irksome that he withdrew from it, as he explains in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
preface to his <i>Observations and Experiments on the
Generation of Air from Water</i>, which he published in
pamphlet form at Hackney, with a dedication to the
members of the Lunar Society.</p>
<p>In a letter to Withering, written from Clapton,
October 2, 1792, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... One of the things that I regret the most in being
expelled from Birmingham is the loss of your company and
that of the rest of the Lunar Society. I feel I want the spur
to constant exertion which I had with you. My philosophical
friends here are cold and distant. Mr Cavendish never
expressed the least concern on account of anything I had
suffered, though I joined a party with which he was, and talked
with them some time. I do not expect to have much intercourse
with any of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, however, nearly replaced my apparatus, and intend
not to be idle. I have already made some experiments relating
to the <i>doctrine of phlogiston</i>, and when I have made a few more
shall probably write something on the subject. I am surprised
at the confidence with which the French chemists write; but
I cannot yet learn what they have to object to my last paper
in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>....</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in hopes to have been able to pay my friends of
Birm. a visit long before this time, but was always discouraged,
so that I have now given up the thoughts of it, and
must content myself with seeing as many of them as I can
here.... I do not, however, think I shall continue
here long. Though unwillingly, I shall some time hence follow
my son to France. But as I can <i>do</i> nothing there I will stay
here as long as I can.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To what lengths the Government were determined
to go was seen in their banishment, in 1793, of Thomas
Fyshe Palmer, a gentleman of a highly respectable and
opulent family in Bedfordshire, to Botany Bay for seven
years, because he had been concerned in publishing a
paper in favour of Parliamentary Reform; and in their
treatment of Mr Winterbotham, a Calvinistic minister of
Plymouth Dock, on account of his political opinions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
The mock trial of Mr Winterbotham at Newgate and
the four years&rsquo; imprisonment which followed it, created
a wide-spread feeling of indignation and alarm, and
many families were constrained to leave the country in
disgust. Among them was Priestley&rsquo;s friend and
fellow-sufferer, the worthy Mr Russell, who on his
way to Boston, New England, was captured with his
family by a French privateer and thrown into prison in
Brest.</p>
<p>Priestley, at length, also determined to follow them.
It was however with the greatest reluctance that he
came to that decision. It meant parting from affectionate
and devoted friends to whom he was warmly
attached, whose zeal to serve him and to minister to his
wants far outweighed the hatred of those who sought
to cover him with oblivion. It meant too the relinquishment
in large measure of his philosophical pursuits
since he could not hope to procure elsewhere the same
facilities for inquiry that he enjoyed here. More than
all it seemed to mean the relinquishment of what was
still dearer to him&mdash;his active efforts in the propagation
of Unitarianism. Lastly it meant in all human probability
a lasting severance from the daughter to whom he was
so tenderly attached. He was largely guided to his
decision by consideration for his sons, since, as he says,
he found that the bigotry of the country in general
made it impossible for him to place them here with any
advantage. His second son, William, had been some
time in France, but on the breaking out of the troubles
in that country he had embarked for America, where his
two brothers, Joseph and Henry, met him. They had
a project of founding a settlement near the head of the
Susquehanna in Pennsylvania, and several of Priestley&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
friends at home, among them Mr William Russell of
Birmingham, a leader of the New Meeting-House, were
directly interested in the scheme.</p>
<p>Priestley at length decided to throw in his lot
with his sons, and in the preface to his <i>Fast and Farewell
Sermons</i>, which he delivered to his Hackney congregation
on the eve of his departure, he gave his reasons for
leaving the country:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After the riots in Birmingham it was the expectation,
and evidently the wish of many persons, that I should immediately
fly to France or America. But I had no consciousness
of guilt to induce me to fly from my country. On the
contrary, I came directly to London, and instantly, by means
of my friend, Mr Russell, signified to the King&rsquo;s ministers
that I <i>was</i> there and ready, if they thought proper, to be
interrogated on the subject of the riots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill-treated as I thought I had been, not merely by the
populace of Birmingham, for they were the mere tools of their
superiors, but by the country in general, which evidently
exulted in our sufferings, and afterwards by the representatives
of the nation, who refused to inquire into the cause of them, I
own I was not without deliberating upon the subject of emigration;
and several flattering proposals were made to me, especially
from France, which was then at peace within itself and with
all the world; and I was at one time much inclined to go
thither, on account of its nearness to England, the agreeableness
of its climate, and my having many friends there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I likewise considered that if I went thither I should
have no employment of the kind to which I had been
accustomed; and the season of active life not being, according
to the course of nature, quite over, I wished to make as much
use of it as I could. I therefore determined to continue in
England, exposed as I was not only to unbounded obloquy
and insult, but to every kind of outrage; and after my invitation
to succeed my friend Dr Price I had no hesitation about
it....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to show how insecure his position
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
was, and how impossible it was to follow his avocations
in peace, in face of the odium and insult he continually
met with:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These facts not only show how general was the idea of my
particular insecurity in this country, but what is of much more
consequence, and highly interesting to the country at large, an
idea of the general disposition to rioting and violence that
prevails in it, and that the Dissenters are the objects of it.
Mr Pitt very justly observed, in his speech on the subject of
the riots at Birmingham, that it was &lsquo;the effervescence of the
public mind.&rsquo; Indeed, the effervescible matter has existed in
this country ever since the civil wars in the time of Charles I.,
and it was particularly apparent in the reign of Queen Anne.
But the power of Government under the former princes of the
House of Hanover prevented its doing any mischief. The
late events show that this power is no longer exerted as it
used to be, but that on the contrary there prevails an idea, well
or ill founded, that tumultuary proceedings against Dissenters
will not receive any effectual discouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what has taken place with respect to Birmingham,
all idea of much hazard for insulting and abusing the Dissenters
is entirely vanished; whereas the disposition to injure the
Catholics was effectually checked by the proceedings of the
year 1780. From that time they have been safe, and rejoice
in it. But from the year 1791 the Dissenters have been more
exposed to insult and outrage than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The necessity I was under of sending my sons out of this
country was my principal inducement to send the little property
that I had out of it too; so that I had nothing in England
besides my library, apparatus and household goods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this I felt myself greatly relieved, it being of little consequence
where a man already turned sixty ends his days.
Whatever good or evil I have been capable of is now chiefly
done; and I trust that the same consciousness of integrity which
has supported me hitherto will carry me through anything that
may yet be reserved for me. Seeing, however, no great prospect
of doing much good, or having much enjoyment here,
I am now preparing to follow my sons; hoping to be of some
use to them in their present unsettled state, and that Providence
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
may yet, advancing in years as I am, find me some sphere of
usefulness with them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to deal with the charge that he was
a factious, political parson who preached sedition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As to the great odium that I have incurred, the charge of
<i>sedition</i>, or my being an enemy to the constitution or peace of
my country, is a mere pretence for it; though it has been so
much urged that it is now generally believed, and all attempts
to undeceive the public with respect to it avail nothing at all.
The whole course of my studies from early life shows how
little <i>politics</i> of any kind have been my object. Indeed, to have
written so much as I have in <i>theology</i>, and to have done so
much in <i>experimental philosophy</i>, and at the same time to have
had my mind occupied, as it is supposed to have been, with
factious politics, I must have had faculties more than human.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true, he says, he wrote a pamphlet &ldquo;On the
State of Liberty in this Country&rdquo; at the time of Wilkes&rsquo;s
election for Middlesex, and at the request of Franklin
he wrote an address to the Dissenters on the subject of
the approaching rupture with America; but he has
nothing to reproach himself with on that score, and
posterity agrees with him. His connection with the
Marquis of Lansdowne was in no sense political.
&ldquo;Although,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I entered into almost all his
views, as thinking them just and liberal, I never wrote
a single political pamphlet, or even a paragraph in a
newspaper, all the time that I was with him, which was
seven years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had never preached a political sermon in his life,
unless such as he believed all Dissenters usually
preached on the 5th of November in favour of civil and
religious liberty may be said to be political. Even on
those occasions he had never advanced any sentiment
that would have made him until then obnoxious to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
administration of this country. The doctrines he adopted
when young, and which were even popular then (except
with the clergy, who were at that time generally disaffected
to the family on the throne), he could not now
abandon merely because the times were so changed
that they had become unpopular and the expression of
them hazardous.</p>
<p>Although he did not disapprove of societies for
political information, he never was a member of one,
nor did he ever attend any public meeting if he could
decently avoid it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If, then, my real crime has not been <i>sedition</i>, or <i>treason</i>,
what has it been? For every <i>effect</i> must have some adequate
<i>cause</i>, and therefore the odium that I have incurred must have
been owing to something in my declared sentiments or conduct
that has exposed me to it. In my opinion it cannot have been
anything but my open hostility to the doctrines of the
Established Church, and more especially to all civil establishments
of religion whatever. This has brought upon me the
implacable resentment of the great body of the clergy; and
they have found other methods of opposing me besides
<i>argument</i> and that use of the <i>press</i> which is equally open to us
all. They have also found an able ally and champion in Mr
Burke, who (without any provocation except that of answering
his book on the French Revolution) has taken several opportunities
of inveighing against me in a place where he knows I
cannot reply to him, and from which he also knows that his
accusation will reach every corner of the country and consequently
thousands of persons who will never read any writings
of mine. They have had another, and still more effectual
vehicle of their abuse in what are called the <i>treasury newpapers</i>,
and other popular publications.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I could, if I were so disposed, give my readers many more
instances of the bigotry of the clergy of the Church of England
with respect to me which could not fail to excite in generous
minds equal indignation and contempt: but I forbear. Had
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
I, however, foreseen what I am now witness to, I certainly should
not have made any attempt to replace my library or apparatus,
and I soon repented of having done it. But this being done,
I was willing to make some use of both before another interruption
of my pursuits.... I hoped to have had no occasion for
more than one, and that a final, remove. But the circumstances
above mentioned have induced me, though with great and
sincere regret, to undertake another, and to a greater distance
than any that I have hitherto made.... And I trust that the
same good Providence which has attended me hitherto, and made
me happy in my present situation, and all my former ones, will
attend and bless me in which may still be before me. In all
events the will of God be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot refrain from repeating again that I leave my native
country with real regret, never expecting to find anywhere else
society so suited to my disposition and habits, such friends as
I have here (whose attachment has been more than a balance
to all the abuse I have met with from others), and especially to
replace one particular Christian friend, in whose absence I shall,
for some time at least, find all the world a blank. Still less
can I expect to resume my favourite pursuits with anything
like the advantages I enjoy here. In leaving this country I
also abandon a source of maintenance which I can but ill bear
to lose. I can, however, truly say that I leave it without any
resentment or ill-will. On the contrary, I sincerely wish my
countrymen all happiness; and when the time for reflection
(which my absence may accelerate) shall come they will, I am
confident, do me more justice. They will be convinced that
every suspicion they have been led to entertain to my disadvantage
has been ill founded, and that I have even some claim
to their gratitude and esteem. In this case I shall look with
satisfaction to the time when, if my life be prolonged, I may
visit my friends in this country; and perhaps I may, notwithstanding
my removal for the present, find a grave (as I believe
is naturally the wish of every man) in the land that gave me
birth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the time of his departure drew near his friends
vied with each other in their expressions of esteem and
affection and many evidences of their regret were
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
offered to him. Among these was a silver inkstand
from some of his admirers in the University of Cambridge,
on which was an inscription of their sorrow
&ldquo;that this expression of their esteem should be
occasioned by the ingratitude of their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On April 8, 1794, Priestley and his wife set sail from
London, and arrived at New York on June 4.</p>
<p>On the way out he wrote some <i>Observations on the
Cause of the Present Prevalence of Infidelity</i>, which he prefixed
to a new edition of his <i>Letters to the Philosophers
and Politicians of France</i>.</p>
<p>Alas! one of the most distinguished of those
philosophers and politicians was even then no more.
Coffinhal had pronounced his judgment, declaring &ldquo;the
Republic has no need of men of science,&rdquo; and whilst
Priestley was on the high seas his great protagonist,
Lavoisier, more unfortunate even than he, met his death
on the scaffold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Such was the treatment bestowed upon the best of their
citizens by two nations which considered themselves as without
exception the most civilised and enlightened in the
world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Priestley was well received in New York, many
people meeting him on landing, and he was presented
with addresses of welcome from various societies.
After a stay of about a fortnight he proceeded to
Philadelphia and received an address from the American
Philosophical Society, and by a unanimous vote of the
trustees was offered the Professorship of Chemistry
in the University of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In the following July, in order to escape from the
heat of the city, he moved to Northumberland, a town
about a hundred and thirty miles north-west of Philadelphia
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
and situated at the confluence of the north-east
and west branches of the Susquehanna, near to which
place his eldest son, together with certain other persons,
mainly Englishmen, projected a settlement. Priestley
himself had no pecuniary interest, as has been stated, in
the undertaking, and he was not consulted in its
formation, nor had he even decided to join it if carried
into effect. We learn from his son&rsquo;s account that the
scheme of settlement was not to be confined to any
particular class or character of men, religious or political.
It was set on foot to be, as it were, a rallying point for
the English, who were at that period emigrating to
America in great numbers, and who, it was thought,
would be more happy in society of the kind they had
been accustomed to than they would be if dispersed
through the whole of the States.</p>
<p>Owing to disagreements among the projectors, the
scheme of the settlement fell through. Priestley,
however, who was charmed with the beauty of its
situation and the nature of its surroundings, determined
to settle at Northumberland. Although at that time
remote from any considerable town it was obviously
destined to become a great thoroughfare. It was
apparently healthy and less enervating, at least in
summer time, than Philadelphia. Living was cheaper
there than in that city, and he would be more free from
care and more at liberty to follow his own pursuits
than if burdened with the responsibilities of teaching.
Lastly, his poor wife, who had never recovered from the
shock of the Birmingham riots, needed rest and quiet.
On these grounds, therefore, he decided to decline the
offer of the Professorship at Philadelphia, as well as an invitation
to take charge of an Unitarian congregation at
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
New York, and to spend his remaining days in peace and
retirement on the beautiful spot he had chosen. The
year before his death he was offered the principalship of
the University of Pennsylvania in succession to Dr
Euen, but this office also he declined.</p>
<p>On his first settling at Northumberland in 1795 he was
mainly occupied with his theological and metaphysical
studies. During this year he published the work which
had occupied him during his voyage from England, his
<i>Fast and Farewell Sermons</i>, some tracts in defence of
Unitarianism, and the third part of his <i>Letters to a
Philosophical Unbeliever</i>, in answer to Paine&rsquo;s <i>Age of
Reason</i>, and he continued his <i>Church History from the
Fall of the Western Empire to the Reformation</i>. In the
house he had first occupied, which was barely sufficient
in size to contain the family, he had little opportunity or
convenience for doing experimental work.</p>
<p>Still, he made some observations on the analysis of air,
and continued his inquiries on the generation of air from
water.</p>
<p>Having determined to make Northumberland his
home, he proceeded to build a house more suitable to
his needs and pursuits, and, as his letters of the period
show, its planning and arrangement gave him much
thought and greatly interested him.</p>
<p>The house, which still exists, is similar in character to
many middle-class American houses built in the country,
a plain substantial erection, covered with match-boarding
and fitted with jalousies, and to the front a loggia or
verandah. The laboratory is a small building to the
side, partially shaded by a large, wide-spreading tree.</p>
<p>In the autumn of this year he lost his youngest son,
Henry, a bright and intelligent youth, of whom he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
remarkably fond. This loss greatly affected him, for he
had hopes that the young man would follow him in his
theological and philosophical pursuits, to which he had
shown an inclination. The death of his son was even
more profoundly felt by his wife, whose health and
spirits now began rapidly to decline, and she too passed
away a few months later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Through life,&rdquo; says her son, &ldquo;she had been truly a helpmeet
for him; supporting him under all his trials and sufferings
with a constancy and perseverance truly praiseworthy, and who,
as he himself, in noting the event in his diary, justly observes,
&lsquo;was of a noble and generous mind, and cared much for others
and little for herself through life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At about this period he preached and printed another
of his defences of Unitarianism and completed his
<i>Church History</i>, and began the compilation of his last
treatise in defence of phlogiston.</p>
<p>He spent the spring of 1796 in Philadelphia, where
he delivered a series of lectures on the evidences of
revelation to crowded audiences, including most of
the members of the United States Congress, at that
time sitting in Philadelphia, and of the executive officers
of the Government. He delivered a second series on
the same subject in the spring of the following year,
but with less success, partly owing, his son imagines,
to the novelty of the thing having passed away, and
partly from prejudices that began to be excited against
him on account of his supposed political principles. In
reality Priestley took even less interest in the politics of
America than he had done in those of his own country.
He seldom read the debates in Congress, and beyond
Adams and Jefferson he knew few of the leading
politicians. He never attended a political meeting or
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
took part directly or indirectly in an election, and
excepting an article in a newspaper called &ldquo;Aurora,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Maxims of Political Arithmetic,&rdquo; and signed &ldquo;A Quaker
in Politics,&rdquo; he wrote nothing on the subject of politics.
At that period political feeling ran high and politics were
the one subject of conversation, and to some extent,
therefore, he could not escape their discussion, but it
was noticed that he always argued on the side of liberty.
As regards British politics his speculations went no
further than a reform in Parliament, such as that which
was accomplished less than thirty years after his death.
He had no desire to see changed the constitution of the
kingdom as vested in King, Lords and Commons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He used frequently to say,&rdquo; says his son, &ldquo;and it was
said of him, that though he was an Unitarian in religion he
was in that country a Trinitarian in politics. When he came
to America he found reason to change his opinions, and he
became a decided friend to the general principles and practice
of a completely representative Government, founded upon
universal suffrage, and excluding hereditary privileges, as it
exists in this country. This change was naturally produced
by observing the ease and happiness with which the people
lived, and the unexampled prosperity of the country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in his feelings he was still an Englishman. He
never was naturalised, saying that as he had been born
and had lived an Englishman he would die one, let what
might be the consequence.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1797 his new library and laboratory
were finished, his books once more arranged and
much of his old apparatus installed. He found workmen in
Northumberland who could repair his instruments and
make such new ones as he wanted. He was thus able
to resume the kind of life he led at Birmingham, spending
much of the day in the laboratory or alternately
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
in his study, sometimes engaged on experimental
philosophy, at other times in the composition of the
theological works which seemed to flow in an unending
stream from his pen. He delighted to walk in his
garden and to view the beautiful prospect it afforded
him of the river and the distant landscape. He had,
too, a kindly interest in the whole community, and noted
with pleasure the many little improvements going
forward in and about the town. There was no apparent
abatement in the vigour of his mind or in the keenness
and enthusiasm with which he followed the extraordinary
expansion of the science he loved so well
during the opening years of the nineteenth century.
In a letter to Humphry Davy, then at the outset of his
brilliant career, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It gives me peculiar satisfaction that, as I am far advanced
in life and cannot expect to do much more, I shall leave so able
a fellow-labourer of my own country in the great fields of
experimental philosophy.... I rejoice that you are so
young a man; and perceiving the ardour with which you
begin your career I have no doubts of your success.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following letter to his old friend Mrs Barbauld,
with whom he kept up a correspondence to the last,
gives some account of his condition at this time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;This will, I hope, be delivered, as it will
be conveyed by my son. How happy should I think myself
to wait on you and Mr Barbauld in person. Should there be
a <i>peace</i>, I do promise myself that pleasure, but at present this
great blessing seems to be at a great distance. How many
melancholy changes have taken place since I left England, and
among these is the death of Dr Enfield, a man at least ten
years younger than me, and to appearance more healthy.
I am also much alarmed at the accounts I receive of your
brother [Dr John Aiken], whom I left in perfect health,
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
but the last were rather more favourable. His life is of great
value, both to his relatives, acquaintances and the world at
large, few men having been more usefully employed. I am
willing to hope he is yet reserved for more usefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I compare the perturbed state of Europe with the
quiet of this place I wish all my friends were here, provided
they could find sufficient employment to be happy; but if they
be like myself they must be content to be idle, except so far
as they can make themselves employment in their closets. My
library and laboratory sufficiently occupy me, and of common
society I have as much as I want. A few more <i>rational Christians</i>
to form a society would make this place a paradise to me,
and this would be wanting in many parts of England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pleasure to be in a place that is continually and
visibly improving, and this is the case here to an astonishing
degree. In every year we find a very sensible difference, and
in all probability improvements of all kind will go on more
rapidly than ever. Nature has done everything that can be
done for any place. Perhaps you have seen the views of
it taken by Miss Daich. They are not by any means too
flattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I have my daughter here I should be happy indeed.
But this, I fear, is not likely to be accomplished, owing to the
strange obstinacy and prejudice of Mr Finch. Her trials must
be very great, but she is naturally cheerful, and has a strong
sense of <i>religion</i>, which, I hope, will support her. This, sufficiently
impressed, will make us equal to everything. Your
kindness to her affects me much. <i>A friend in need is a friend
indeed.</i> Something will, I hope, be done for her before my
son returns, but what it can be I do not know. Her uncle has
some proposal to make to my son in her favour, but the obstinacy
of Mr Finch may defeat everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have obliged me very much by the exquisite little poem
you sent me. I hope you will add to the obligation by the
communication of the fragment on the &lsquo;Game of Chess,&rsquo; or any
other little piece you may think proper to send me. You had
no copy of your first poem to my wife, or I should value <i>that</i>
above any other, and also the little poem you wrote on the
birth of Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall always be very happy to hear from you; and, with my
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
best respects to Mr Barbauld, I am, dear Madam, yours sincerely,
<span class="lr"><span class="sc">J. Priestley</span>.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>His son has given us a faithful picture of his closing
years and of the serenity of the evening of his life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For the last four years of his life he lived under an
administration, the principles and practice of which he perfectly
approved, and with Mr Jefferson, the head of that administration,
he frequently corresponded, and they had for each other
a mutual regard and esteem. He enjoyed the esteem of the
wisest and best men in the country, particularly at Philadelphia,
where his religion and his politics did not prevent his being
kindly and cheerfully received by great numbers of opposite
opinions in both, who thus paid homage to his knowledge and
virtue.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1800 he put together his last scientific work, and
the one which he regarded as the crown of all his
efforts, <i>viz.</i>, his <i>Doctrine of Phlogiston Established</i>. It can
never be said of Priestley that he was to one thing
constant never: versatile as he was, and with an extraordinary
capacity for adaptation and change in matters of
philosophy and theological doctrine, he was ever constant
to phlogiston.</p>
<p>During the spring of 1801, whilst on a visit to
Philadelphia, he had an attack of fever from which he
never wholly recovered. It left him predisposed to the
fever and ague at that time prevalent at Northumberland
and he had a succession of attacks which weakened him
greatly. Nevertheless, his spirits were uniformly good
and his complacency and cheerfulness of manner never
left him; and although he was incapable of taking much
physical exercise and had to give up working in his
garden, he spent a considerable amount of time in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
laboratory, experimenting with all the enthusiasm and
eagerness of his most active period with the newly-discovered
pile of Volta, and sending his results to
<i>Nicholson&rsquo;s Journal</i>.</p>
<p>In 1802 he was enabled to send his <i>Church History</i>
to press, owing to the action of his friends in England,
who, unknown to him, had set a subscription on foot
sufficient to cover the expense of publication.</p>
<p>Although he was obviously failing in strength,
owing to gastric troubles, he continued to work on
either in his study or in his laboratory. He sent a
couple of papers to the American Philosophical Society
on scientific subjects, and he published an essay on
<i>Jesus and Socrates Compared</i>. In the November of 1803
it was evident that his end was approaching. Still he
struggled on, hoping by careful attention to his diet he
might still see the spring. He told the physician who
attended him that if he could but patch him up for six
months longer he should be perfectly satisfied, as he
should in that time be able to complete the printing of
his works. So precarious did he consider his life that
he took the precaution of transcribing one day in longhand
what he had composed the day before in shorthand,
that he might by that means leave the work
complete as far as it went should he not live to finish
the whole.</p>
<p>With the beginning of 1804 his weakness had greatly
increased. In his diary for January 31 he notes:&mdash;&ldquo;Ill
all day&mdash;not able to speak for nearly three hours.&rdquo;
Still he rose, dressed and shaved himself (which he
never omitted doing every morning till within two days
of his death), went to his laboratory and lit his fire, but
found his weakness so great that he was obliged to get
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
back to his study. During the next and following days
he was better, and was able to see to the correction of
his proof-sheets, but on February 4 he took to his bed,
although he was able to read and look over a sheet of
proof and to check the Greek and Hebrew quotations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the course of the day,&rdquo; says his son, &ldquo;he expressed his
gratitude in being permitted to die quietly in his family, without
pain, with every convenience and comfort he could wish for.
He dwelt upon the peculiarly happy situation in which it had
pleased the Divine Being to place him in life, and the great
advantage he had enjoyed in the acquaintance and friendship
of some of the best and wisest men in the age in which he
lived, and the satisfaction he derived from having led a useful
as well as a happy life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the evening he had his grandchildren brought to
his bedside, saying it gave him great pleasure to see
the little things kneel. After prayers they wished him
a good-night and he gave each his blessing, exhorting
them all to continue to love each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And you, little thing,&rdquo; speaking to the youngest, &ldquo;remember
the hymn you learned: &lsquo;Birds in their little nests agree.&rsquo; I
am going to sleep as well as you; for death is only a good long
sleep in the grave, and we shall meet again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He lingered through the night, and in the early
morning requested his son to take down some additions
and alterations he wished inserted in his proofs, dictating
as clearly and distinctly as he had ever done in his life.
When these were read to him he said, &ldquo;That is right;
I have now done.&rdquo; Shortly afterwards he put his hand
to his face and breathed his last so easy that those who
were sitting close to him hardly perceived he had passed
away.</p>
<p>What was mortal of him now rests in a little hill-side
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
cemetery overlooking the beautiful river. The spot is
marked with a simple headstone on which is engraven&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s position in the history of science mainly
rests on his discoveries in pneumatic chemistry. The
course of inquiry which he began at Leeds was continued
by him, with characteristic assiduity and conspicuous
success, at Calne, and his labours added largely to the
number of the aeriform bodies which were clearly
recognised as distinct substances, essentially differing
from each other, and not merely modifications of a
common principle, modified or affected by properties
more or less fortuitous and accidental. The old idea
of the nature of &ldquo;air&rdquo; had its origin in the doctrine of
the Four Elements. It is Priestley&rsquo;s merit that he,
more than any man of his time, contributed to the overthrow
of this conception as the basis of a philosophical
system of the constitution of the material universe.
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
Although Priestley could not be unmindful that his
claim to scientific fame was to be found in the succession
of volumes which he called <i>Experiments and Observations
on Different Kinds of Air</i>, the very title suggests that he,
at all events in the outset, was hardly conscious of the
magnitude and true significance of his work. Priestley
was in no real sense a speculative philosopher: he was
indeed pre-eminently the type of man whom Hobbes
disparaged as an &ldquo;experimentarian philosopher,&rdquo; and an
experimentarian philosopher he remained to the end of
his days. He was aware of his limitations, and many
passages from his works, and especially from his correspondence,
might be quoted in proof of this fact. His
simple, unaffected candour was indeed one of the charms
of his character and the secret of much of his influence.
It is reflected in every page of his scientific writings.
His own discoveries, taken collectively, did more than
those of any one of his contemporaries to uproot and
destroy the only generalisation by which his immediate
predecessors had sought to group and connect the
phenomena of chemistry, but he was wholly unable to
perceive this fact. A patient and industrious observer,
absolutely truthful, and, as he hoped and believed,
unbiassed and impartial, he was nevertheless entirely
lacking in the higher qualities of the imagination or in
that power of divination which is the characteristic of
men of the type of Newton. The contrast between
Priestley&mdash;the social, political and theological reformer,
always in advance of his times, receptive, fearless and
insistent; and Priestley the man of science&mdash;timorous
and halting when he might well be bold, conservative
and orthodox when almost every other active worker
was heterodox and progressive&mdash;is most striking. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
yet, such is the irony of circumstance, Priestley&rsquo;s name
mainly lives as that of a chemical philosopher. When
men have desired to do him honour, and have sought to
perpetuate his memory by statues in public places, he is
generally represented as making a chemical experiment.
In reality, great as Priestley&rsquo;s merit is as an experimentarian
philosopher, his greater claim on our regard
and esteem rests upon his struggles and his sufferings
in the cause of civil, political and religious liberty.</p>
<p>The years which Priestley spent at Calne constitute
the most fruitful period of his scientific career. Practically
all that he did in the way of solid achievement
and of addition to the armoury of science was effected
during that time. Although, after leaving Lord
Shelburne, he continued to pursue scientific inquiry
with his wonted zeal and industry, doubtless adding
thereby to his fame among his contemporaries, posterity
has set the true measure of appreciation to his later
efforts. He doubtless made many hundreds of experiments
in connection with more or less well-defined
trains of inquiry; nevertheless, it cannot be maintained
that during his subsequent period he added many first-rate
facts to our knowledge, or indeed discovered any
facts at all comparable in importance with those he
ascertained during his life in Wiltshire. On the
contrary, what he did observe&mdash;as for example the
seeming conversion of water into air&mdash;too frequently
led him astray and was the cause of error to himself and
others. Thus Watt&rsquo;s claim to be considered as an
independent, if not the first and true, discoverer of the
real chemical nature of water is based upon Priestley&rsquo;s
experimental blunders. Watt was undoubtedly accurate
in his surmise, but the surmise was right in spite of, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
not by reason of, Priestley&rsquo;s experimental evidence.
Priestley recorded his experiments with such fulness
that it is now easy to perceive where he went wrong.
He was constantly on the verge of a discovery, sometimes
indeed of a discovery of cardinal importance, but
as constantly it eluded his grasp. The experiments on
the seeming conversion of water into air might have led
him, when he got over his chagrin on the detection of
the real cause of his error, to the recognition of the
underlying truth in it, namely, the principle of the
diffusion of gases. He was, of course, familiar with
the fact that the various gases he discovered, or which
were known to him, differed in relative density, and he
knew perfectly well that they tended to escape from
the bottles in which they were contained if these were
uncovered and freely exposed to the air. But, so far as
we can learn, he never seems to have pondered on these
facts, or noted their connection with the phenomena he
observed in the course of his many experiments with
Wedgwood&rsquo;s retorts, and of the interchange of the
water vapour he introduced into them with the gases of
the fire which heated them. And yet, had he perceived
even a glimmer of the truth he had sufficient means at
his disposal, and sufficient knowledge from his own
work and that of his contemporaries, to make the great
step which it was reserved to Graham to accomplish
half a century later.</p>
<p>Whilst the chief importance of the <i>Experiments and
Observations on Different Kinds of Air</i> is that it is
Priestley&rsquo;s <i>magnum opus</i>, to his biographer it has the
additional interest of affording an insight into the
personal character and intellectual attributes of its
author. Few writers on scientific subjects have ever
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
taken their readers so completely into their confidence
as Priestley. Whatever he knows or thinks he tells:
doubts, perplexities, blunders are set down with the
most refreshing candour; one forgives the prolixity and
occasional tediousness, even the little touches of self-satisfaction,
in view of the transparent honesty of
purpose, the single-minded pursuit of truth for its own
sake, wholly apart from preconception or bias of
dogma which shine on every page. As key-notes to
character, even the dedications and prefaces to the
several volumes have their peculiar value and charm, as
evidence of the workings of an ingenuous mind.</p>
<p>The publication of the six volumes comprising the
original work&mdash;the edition of greatest value to
Priestley&rsquo;s biographer&mdash;extended from 1775 to 1786.
Although the space at our disposal precludes any
attempt at a full account of the contents, it is necessary
to set these out in such detail as may serve to afford a
just idea of their value, and with such comment as may
be necessary to elucidate their significance.</p>
<p>In the preface to the first volume, which made its
appearance in 1775, with a dedication to Lord Shelburne,
Priestley thinks it necessary to explain why he has
decided, contrary to his original intention, but with the
approbation of the President and of his friends in the
Royal Society, not to send them any more papers on the
subject of &ldquo;Air&rdquo; at present but to make immediate
publication of all he has done with respect to it. In
view, he says, of the rapid progress that has been
made and may be expected to be made in this
branch of knowledge, &ldquo;unnecessary delays in the
publication of experiments relating to it are peculiarly
unjustifiable.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;When, for the sake of a little more reputation, men can
keep brooding over a new fact, in the discovery of which they
might possibly have very little real merit, till they think they
can astonish the world with a system as complete as it is new,
and give mankind a prodigious idea of their judgment and
penetration, they are justly punished for their ingratitude to the
fountain of all knowledge, and for the want of a genuine love
of science and of mankind in finding their boasted discoveries
anticipated and the field of honest fame pre-occupied by men
who, from a natural ardour of mind, engage in philosophical
pursuits, and with an ingenuous simplicity immediately communicate
to others whatever occurs to them in their inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s productions, from the very nature of the
case make no pretensions to completeness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In completing one discovery we never fail to get an imperfect
knowledge of others of which we could have no idea
before, so that we cannot solve one doubt without creating
several new ones.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He farther observes that a person who means to
serve the cause of science effectually must hazard his
own reputation so far as to risk even <i>mistakes</i> in things
of less moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Among a multiplicity of new objects and new relations
some will necessarily pass without sufficient attention; but if a
man be not mistaken in the principal objects of his pursuits he
has no occasion to distress himself about lesser things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the progress of his inquiries he will generally be able to
rectify his own mistakes; or if little and envious souls should
take a malignant pleasure in detecting them for him and
endeavouring to expose him, he is not worthy of the name of a
philosopher if he has not strength of mind sufficient to enable
him not to be disturbed at it. He who does not foolishly
affect to be above the failings of humanity will not be mortified
when it is proved that he is but a man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He made it a rule to disclose the real views with
which he made his experiments. Although, he says,
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
by following a contrary maxim he might have acquired
a character of greater sagacity, he thought that two
good ends were secured by his method&mdash;one as tending
to make his narrative more interesting, and the other as
encouraging other adventurers in experimental philosophy
by showing them that by pursuing even false
lights real and important truths may be discovered, and
that in seeking one thing we often find another. He
believes, however, that he writes more concisely than is
usual with those who publish accounts of their experiments,
and in thus refraining from swelling his book
&ldquo;to a pompous and respectable size&rdquo; he trusts he will
earn the gratitude of those philosophers who, having
but little time to spare for <i>reading</i>, which is always the
case with those who <i>do</i> much themselves, will thereby
be kept not too long from their own pursuits. He
then comments on what he justly considers the amazing
improvements in natural knowledge which have been
made within the century, and contrasts these with the
comparative poverty as regards scientific results of the
many preceding ages, which yet abounded with men
who had no other object but study; and he rejoices to
think that this rapid progress of knowledge, extending
itself not this way or that way only, but in all directions,
will be the means of extirpating all error and prejudice
and of putting an end to all undue and usurped authority
in the business of religion as well as of science.</p>

<p>He regrets that the rich and great in this country, unmindful

usefulness be the object, science has the same advantage over

farther than one particular country and one particular age,

of all mankind and of every age. How trifling is the
fame of any statesman that this country has ever produced to
that of Lord Bacon, of Newton, or of Boyle; and how much
greater are our obligations to such men as these than to any
other in the whole <i>Biographia Britannica</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be interesting to know the sentiments of
Lord Shelburne, then in the cold shade of retirement, as
he perused these passages, and whether he realised the
truth of the little homily from his &ldquo;tame philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preface is followed by an introduction, in which
Priestley gives a rapid and confessedly imperfect survey
of the state of knowledge concerning &ldquo;air&rdquo; prior to
1774. He gives to Boyle the credit of first clearly
recognising that elastic fluids exist differing essentially
from the air of the atmosphere, but agreeing with it in
the properties of weight, elasticity and transparency.
But he also points out that two remarkable kinds of
factitious air had long been known to miners, viz.,
<i>choke damp</i>, which is heavier than air, which lies at the
bottom of pits, extinguishes flame and kills animals;
and the other, called <i>fire damp</i>, which is lighter than
common air, is found, therefore, near the roofs of subterraneous
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
places and is liable to take fire and explode
like gunpowder. &ldquo;The word <i>damp</i> signifies <i>vapour</i> or
<i>exhalation</i> in the German and Saxon languages.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Air of the former kind, besides having been discovered in
various caverns, particularly the Grotta del Cane in Italy, had
also been observed on the surface of fermenting liquors, and
had been called <i>gas</i> (which is the same with <i>geist</i>, or <i>spirit</i>)
by Van Helmont and other German chemists; but afterwards
it obtained the name of <i>fixed air</i>, especially after it had been
discovered by Dr Black of Edinburgh to exist, in a fixed state,
in alkaline salts, chalk, and other calcareous substances.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Black&rsquo;s work is dealt with in half a dozen lines, and a
passing reference is made to Macbride and Brownrigg.
A very imperfect account is given of the work of Hales,
although it is stated that &ldquo;his experiments are so
numerous and various that they are justly esteemed to
be the solid foundation of all our knowledge of this
subject.&rdquo; This section concludes with the mention of
Cavendish&rsquo;s determinations of the relative weights of
fixed air (carbon dioxide), and inflammable air from
metals (hydrogen), and of Lane&rsquo;s observations that
water charged with carbonic acid will dissolve iron,
&ldquo;and thereby become a strong chalybeate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priestley was the last man in the world to seek to
disparage the work of his predecessors or to minimise
what was due to them. In reality he had the intention,
as he distinctly states, to write at his leisure the history
and present state of discoveries relating to air, in a manner
similar to his <i>History of Electricity</i>, and of the <i>Discoveries
Relating to Vision, Light and Colours</i>, when no doubt he
would have done full justice to all concerned. In the
meantime he gives only such particulars as are necessary,
in his judgment, to the understanding of his own work.</p>
<p>The remaining section of the introduction deals with
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
his method of experimenting and with the apparatus he
employed. It is of historical interest as containing
a description of that most useful article of chemical
furniture, his well-known pneumatic trough. He
explains its use and gives details of his modes
of manipulation. What an advance these were in
simplicity, ingenuity and convenience can only be fully
realised by comparing his methods with those of Hales.
Not the least of Priestley&rsquo;s services to science were the
improvements he effected in that section of operative
chemistry which is concerned with the preparation, collection
and storage of gaseous substances.</p>
<p>The main body of the volume is divided into two
parts&mdash;the first dealing with observations made in and
before 1772, the second with observations made in the
year 1773 and in the beginning of 1774. In the outset
Priestley finds himself at a disadvantage in regard to
the only terms at that time in vogue for the factitious
airs, viz., <i>fixed</i>, <i>mephitic</i> and <i>inflammable</i>, which, he
rightly says, are not sufficiently characteristic and
distinct. Strictly speaking, any two of these terms might
be applied to any one of the &ldquo;airs&rdquo; then known. The
inflammable air from metals, as well as choke damp, is
noxious, and therefore mephitic, as is fixed air, and since
the inflammable airs are, apparently, capable of being
imbibed by certain substances they may equally be considered
fixable. The term <i>fixed air</i> had, however, acquired
a distinctive meaning, and rather than introduce a new
term or change the signification of an old one, he would,
with his contemporaries, restrict the term to the
air which had been made the subject of Black&rsquo;s memorable
investigation. The first paper in this section deals
with fixed air; it is practically a reprint of that in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
<i>Phil. Trans.</i> and which has already been described
in sufficient detail. In the course of his experiments
he says he once thought that the readiest method of
procuring fixed air, and in sufficient purity, would be
to heat pounded lime-stone in a gun barrel, &ldquo;making it
pass through the stem of a tobacco pipe or a glass tube
carefully luted to the orifice of it.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In this manner I found that air is produced in great plenty;
but, upon examining it, I found to my great surprise that little
more than one half of it was fixed air, capable of being
absorbed by water; and that the rest was inflammable, sometimes
very weakly, but sometimes pretty highly so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He surmised that this &ldquo;air&rdquo; must come from the
iron, and yet, he noted, it differed from the ordinary
inflammable air from iron by the remarkable blue colour
of its flame, and he concludes that &ldquo;this inflammable
principle may come from some remains of the animals
from which it is thought that all calcareous matter proceeds.&rdquo;
Priestley, we now know, had incidentally converted
some of the fixed air into the only other oxide of
carbon, but he failed to appreciate the significance of his
observation, and the credit of the discovery of carbon
monoxide belongs to Cruikshank.</p>
<p>In his next paper on &ldquo;Air in which Candles have
burned,&rdquo; Priestley made a discovery of the very highest
importance. He had attempted to verify without
success the allegation by the Count de Saluce, made in
the memoirs of the Philosophical Society of Turin, that
air vitiated by the combustion of candles could be
restored by exposure to cold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Though this experiment failed,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I have been so
happy as by accident to have hit upon a method of restoring
air which has been injured by the burning of candles, and to
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
have discovered at least one of the restoratives which Nature
employs for this purpose. It is <i>vegetation</i>. This restoration
of vitiated air, I conjecture, is effected by plants imbibing the
phlogistic matter with which it is overloaded by the burning
of inflammable bodies. But whether there be any foundation
for this conjecture or not, the fact is, I think, indisputable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then proceeds to give an account of his observations
on the growing of plants in confined air which led
to his discovery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One might have imagined,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that since common
air is necessary to vegetable as well as to animal life, both
plants and animals had affected it in the same manner; and I
own I had that expectation when I first put a sprig of mint
into a glass jar standing inverted in a vessel of water: but
when it had continued there for some months I found the air
would neither extinguish the candle, nor was it at all inconvenient
to a mouse, which I put into it.... Finding
that candles would burn very well in air in which plants had
grown a long time, and having had some reason to think that
there was something attending vegetation which restored air
that had been injured by respiration, I thought it was possible
that the same process might also restore the air that had been
injured by the burning of candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, on the 17th of August 1771, I put a sprig of
mint into a quantity of air in which a wax candle had burned
out, and found that on the 27th of the same month another
candle burned perfectly well in it. This experiment I repeated,
without the least variation in the event, not less than eight or
ten times in the remainder of the summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several times I divided the quantity of air in which the
candle had burned out into two parts, and putting the plant
into one of them left the other in the same exposure, contained
also in a glass vessel immersed in water, but without any
plant, and never failed to find that a candle would burn in the
former but not in the latter.... This remarkable
effect does not depend upon anything peculiar to <i>mint</i>, which
was the plant that I always made use of till July 1772; for on
the 16th of that month I found a quantity of this kind of air
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
to be perfectly restored by sprigs of <i>balm</i>, which had grown in
it from the 7th of the same month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That this restoration of air was not owing to any aromatic
effluvia of these two plants not only appeared by the <i>essential
oil of mint</i> having no sensible effect of this kind, but from the
equally complete restoration of this vitiated air by the plant
called <i>groundsel</i>, which is usually ranked among the weeds
and has an offensive smell. Besides, the plant which I have
found to be the most effectual of any that I have tried for this
purpose is <i>spinach</i>, which is of quick growth, but will seldom
thrive long in water.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next paper on &ldquo;Inflammable Air&rdquo; is of slight importance,
and indeed is full of errors. Priestley made no
distinction between the inflammable air obtained by the
action of acids on metals (hydrogen) and that formed by
the destructive distillation of coal and other organic substances
(marsh gas or carbonic oxide, or mixtures of the
two), and his inability to distinguish these different gases
accounts for many of the phenomena he observed and
which he confesses himself unable to explain. The
most sagacious observation in the memoir has reference
to the colour of the electric spark in the different gases
which he accurately describes.</p>
<p>The paper on &ldquo;Air Infected with Animal Respiration
or Putrefection&rdquo; may be considered as the complement of
that on &ldquo;Air in which a Candle has burned out,&rdquo; and is
no less valuable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That candles will burn only a certain time in a given
quantity of air is a fact not better known than it is that animals
can live only a certain time in it; but the cause of the death
of the animal is not better known than that of the
extinction of flame in the same circumstances; and when
once any quantity of air has been rendered noxious by animals
breathing in it as long as they could, I do not know that any
methods have been discovered of rendering it fit for breathing
again. It is evident, however, that there must be some
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
provision in Nature for this purpose, as well as for that of
rendering the air fit for sustaining flame; for without it the whole
mass of the atmosphere would, in time, become unfit for the
purpose of animal life; and yet there is no reason to think that it
is, at present, at all less fit for respiration than it has ever been.
I flatter myself, however, that I have hit upon two of the
methods employed by Nature for this great purpose. How
many others there may be I cannot tell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of these methods he eventually finds to be, as in
the first case, the action of vegetation, and he proves by a
number of decisive experiments</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;that plants, instead of affecting the air in the same manner
with animal respiration, reverse the effects of breathing and
tend to keep the atmosphere sweet and wholesome when it is
become noxious in consequence of animals either living and
breathing, or dying and putrefying in it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other method he conceived to be the action of
water, since he found that by vigorous agitation with
water, air which breathing had rendered noxious could
again be breathed for a further period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think it improbable but that the agitation of the
sea and large lakes may be of some use for the purification of
the atmosphere, and the putrid matter contained in water may
be imbibed by aquatic plants, or be deposited in some other
manner.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a confined volume of common air is placed in
contact with a mixture of iron filings and sulphur made
into a paste with water, a certain portion of the air is
imbibed by the paste. This fact was first observed
by Hales. Priestley repeated the observation and
found that about a fifth or rather more of the volume
of the air was thus absorbed. He noted that the
residual &ldquo;air&rdquo; was rather lighter than common air, it
had no action on lime-water and was exceedingly
noxious to animals, by which is meant that it could not
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
be breathed by them. Priestley had thus prepared
nitrogen, but he failed to recognise the individuality of
this gas.</p>
<p>In his <i>Statical Essays</i> Hales makes mention of an
experiment in which common air and air generated from
pyrites by spirit of nitre made a turbid red mixture, and
in which part of the common air was absorbed. This
phenomenon &ldquo;particularly struck&rdquo; Priestley, who, acting
upon Cavendish&rsquo;s hint that the red appearance was
probably dependent &ldquo;upon the spirit of nitre only&rdquo; and
that the metals might answer as well as pyrites, proceeded
to investigate the action of nitric acid upon a
number of the metals, and as the result of his inquiries
he succeeded in isolating the gas we now know as <i>nitric
oxide</i>, but which he termed <i>nitrous air</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Though,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I cannot say that I altogether like
the term, neither myself nor any of my friends, to whom I
have applied for the purpose, have been able to hit upon a
better.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper exhibits Priestley at his best. In it he
describes all the main properties of nitric oxide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most conspicuous properties of this kind of
air,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is the great diminution of any quantity of
common air with which it is mixed, attended with a turbid red,
or deep orange colour, and a considerable heat....
The diminution of a mixture of this and common air is not
an equal diminution of both the kinds, which is all that Dr
Hales could observe, but of about one fifth of the common air,
and as much of the nitrous air as is necessary to produce that
effect; which, as I have found by many trials, is about one
half as much as the original quantity of common air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know any experiment that is more adapted to
amaze and surprise than this is, which exhibits a quantity of
air which, as it were, devours a quantity of another kind of
air half as large as itself, and yet is so far from gaining any
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
addition to its bulk that it is considerably diminished
by it....</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is exceedingly remarkable that this effervescence and
diminution, occasioned by the mixture of nitrous air, is peculiar
to common air, or <i>air fit for respiration</i>, and, as far as I can
judge from a great number of observations, is at least very
nearly, if not exactly, in proportion to its fitness for this
purpose; so that by this means the goodness of air may be
distinguished much more accurately than it can be done by
putting mice or any other animals to breathe in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a most agreeable discovery to me, as I hope it
may be a useful one to the public; especially as from this
time I had no occasion for so large a stock of mice as I had
been used to keep for the purpose of these experiments.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley here suggests the basis of a method of
<i>Eudiometry</i>, or method of measuring the goodness of
air, which in his hands, but more especially in those of
Cavendish, led to most important results. The quantitative
analysis of the air may be said to have taken its
rise from the publication of Priestley&rsquo;s paper.</p>
<p>In the course of subsequent work on nitrous air
Priestley had occasion to study its action on iron,
whereby he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A most remarkable and most unexpected change was
made in the nitrous air,&rdquo; the iron &ldquo;makes it not only to admit
a candle to burn in it, but enables it to burn with an <i>enlarged
flame</i>.... Sometimes I have perceived the flame of the
candle, in these circumstances, to be twice as large as it is
naturally, and sometimes not less than five or six times larger;
and yet without anything like an <i>explosion</i>, as in the firing of
the weakest inflammable air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley in this manner obtained <i>nitrous oxide</i>, the
properties of which he subsequently studied in some
detail.</p>
<p>In the paper which follows, <i>viz.</i>, &ldquo;On Air infected with
the Fumes of Burning Charcoal,&rdquo; he incidentally gains
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
further insight into the nature of atmospheric air. By
what he called throwing the focus of a burning mirror on
charcoal suspended in air contained in a glass tube standing
over water or mercury&mdash;a favourite method of his when
he had occasion to heat a substance in a gas&mdash;he could
observe the phenomena with great precision. He
noticed the formation of the fixed air and determined
the degree of diminution when the burning took place
over water or over lime-water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In this manner,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I diminished a given quantity
of air one-fifth. Air thus diminished by the fumes of burning
charcoal not only extinguishes flame, but is in the highest degree
noxious to animals; it makes no effervescence with nitrous air,
and is incapable of being diminished any farther by the fumes
of more charcoal.... All my observations show that
air which has once been fully diminished ... is not only
incapable of any further diminution ... but that it has likewise
acquired <i>new properties</i>, most remarkably different from
those which it had before....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By heating pieces of lead and tin in air by means of
a burning glass he observed the formation of a metallic
calx, the volume of air was diminished, and it also
&ldquo;was in the highest degree noxious and made no
effervescence with nitrous air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The real significance of these phenomena was, however,
wholly unperceived by Priestley, and phlogiston, as
usual, led him astray. He had, of course, in all these
experiments prepared <i>nitrogen</i>, and in a state of sensible
purity. He imagined, however, that he had simply
&ldquo;phlogisticated&rdquo; the air, the phlogiston coming from the
charcoal and the metals, and that this phlogisticated air
was imbibed by the water.</p>
<p>An experiment described by Cavendish led Priestley to
study the action of &ldquo;Spirit of Salt&rdquo; (hydrochloric acid)
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
upon copper. As Cavendish had already stated, the gas
so evolved &ldquo;lost its electricity by coming into contact
with water.&rdquo; By collecting the gas over mercury
Priestley was able to study its properties more exactly.
From certain anomalies in the experiments he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I concluded that this subtle air did not arise from the
copper, but from the spirit of salt; and presently making the
experiment with the acid only, without any copper, or metal of
any kind, this air was immediately produced in as great plenty
as before; so that this remarkable kind of air is, in fact,
nothing more than the vapour, or fumes of spirit of salt, which
appear to be of such a nature that they are not liable to be
condensed by cold, like the vapour of water and other fluids,
and therefore may be very properly called an <i>acid air</i>, or more
restrictively the <i>marine acid air</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new gas discovered by Priestley we now call
hydrogen chloride. Ordinary hydrochloric acid is simply
an aqueous solution of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Water impregnated with it makes the strongest spirit of
salt that I have seen, dissolving iron with the most rapidity....
Iron filings, being admitted to this air, were dissolved by it pretty
fast, half of the air disappearing and the other half becoming
inflammable air, not absorbed by water. Putting chalk to it,
fixed air was produced.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He subsequently found that the marine acid air was
more conveniently made by the action of oil of vitriol
upon common salt.</p>
<p>From the &ldquo;miscellaneous observations&rdquo; with which
this section of the volume concludes, there can be little
doubt that Priestley, without knowing it, had prepared
oxygen gas from nitre as far back as 1771. The
accounts he gives of the behaviour of the gas obtained
by heating nitre in a gun-barrel plainly indicate this
fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;A candle,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;not only burned but the flame was
increased, and something was heard like a hissing similar to
the decrepitation of nitre in an open fire.&rdquo; He also noted the
effect of nitrous air upon it and concludes that &ldquo;this series of
facts relating to air extracted from nitre appear to me to be
very extraordinary and important, and in able hands may lead to
considerable discoveries.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second section of the volume deals with experiments
and observations made in 1773 and the beginning
of 1774, and opens with an account of the discovery of
<i>ammonia gas</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After I had made the discovery of the <i>marine acid air</i>,
which the vapour of spirit of salt may properly enough be
called ... it occurred to me that by a process similar to that by
which this <i>acid</i> air is expelled from the spirit of salt an <i>alkaline</i>
air might be expelled from substances containing volatile
alkali.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly I procured some volatile spirit of sal
ammoniac, and having put it into a thin phial, and heated it
with the flame of a candle, I presently found that a great
quantity of vapour was discharged from it; and being received
in a vessel of quicksilver, standing in a basin of quicksilver, it
continued in the form of a transparent and permanent air, not
at all condensed by cold; so that I had the same opportunity
of making experiments upon it as I had before on the acid air,
being in the same favourable circumstances.... Wanting,
however, to procure this air in greater quantities, and this
method being rather expensive, it occurred to me that alkaline
air might probably be procured, with the most ease and convenience,
from the original materials, mixed in the same proportions
that chemists had found by experience to answer the
best for the production of the volatile spirit of sal ammoniac.
Accordingly I mixed one-fourth of pounded sal ammoniac
with three-fourths of slaked lime; and filling a phial with the
mixture, I presently found it completely answered my purpose.
The heat of a candle expelled from this mixture a prodigious
quantity of alkaline air; and the same materials ... would serve
me a considerable time without changing....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>He next studied the properties of the alkaline air. He
found, of course, it was readily soluble in water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Having satisfied myself with respect to the relation that
alkaline air bears to water, I was impatient to find what would
be the consequence of mixing this new air with the other kinds
with which I was acquainted before, and especially with <i>acid</i>
air; having a notion that these two airs, being of opposite
natures, might compose a <i>neutral air</i>, and perhaps the very
same thing with common air. But the moment that these two
kinds of air came into contact a beautiful white cloud was
formed, and presently filled the whole vessel in which they
were contained.... When the cloud was subsided there appeared
to be formed a solid <i>white salt</i>, which was found to be the
common <i>sal ammoniac</i>, or the marine acid united to the volatile
alkali....</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fixed air</i> admitted to alkaline air formed oblong and slender
crystals.... These crystals must be the same thing with the
volatile alkalis which chemists get in a solid form by the
distillation of sal ammoniac with fixed alkaline salts....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alkaline air, I was surprised to find, is slightly inflammable....</p>
<p>&ldquo;That alkaline air is lighter than acid air is evident from
the appearances that attend the mixture, which are indeed very
beautiful. When acid air is introduced into a vessel containing
alkaline air, the white cloud which they form appears at the
bottom only and ascends gradually. But when the alkaline air
is put to the acid the whole becomes immediately cloudy quite
to the top of the vessel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Up to now Priestley had mainly confined himself to
the narration of the new <i>facts</i> which he had discovered,
barely mentioning any <i>hypotheses</i> that occurred to him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The reason why I was so much upon my guard in this
respect was lest, in consequence of attaching myself to any
hypothesis too soon, the success of my future inquiries might
be obstructed. But subsequent experiments having thrown
great light upon the preceding ones, and having confirmed the
few conjectures I then advanced, I may now venture to speak
of my hypotheses with a little less diffidence. Still, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
I shall be ready to relinquish any notions I may now entertain
if new facts should hereafter appear not to favour them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a paper on &ldquo;Common Air Diminished and made
Noxious by Various Processes&rdquo; he attempts to apply the
current doctrine of phlogiston to account for the various
phenomena he has observed, and with what success
may be inferred from his conclusion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;that in the precipitation of lime by breathing into lime-water,
the fixed air, which incorporates with lime, comes not
from the lungs but from the common air, decomposed by the
phlogiston exhaled from them, and discharged, after having
been taken in with the aliment, and having performed its
function in the animal system.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s attempts at theorising brought little satisfaction
to him or to his readers. Indeed he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to be apprehensive lest, after being considered
as a <i>dry experimenter</i>, I should pass into the opposite character
of a <i>visionary theorist</i>.... In extenuation of my offence
let it, however, be considered that <i>theory and experiments</i>
necessarily go hand-in-hand, every process being intended
to ascertain some particular <i>hypothesis</i>, which, in fact, is only
a conjecture concerning the circumstances or the cause of
some natural operation; consequently that the boldest and
most original experimenters are those who, giving free scope to
their imaginations, admit the combination of the most distant
ideas; and that though many of these associations of ideas will
be wild and chimerical, yet that others will have the chance of
giving rise to the greatest and most capital discoveries, such as
very cautious, timid, sober and slow-thinking people would
never have come at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Isaac Newton himself, notwithstanding the great advantage
which he derived from a habit of <i>patient thinking</i>,
indulged bold and eccentric thoughts, of which his queries at
the end of his book of Optics are a sufficient evidence. And
a quick conception of distant analogies, which is the great key
to unlock the secrets of Nature, is by no means incompatible
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
with the spirit of <i>perseverance</i> in investigations calculated to
ascertain and pursue those analogies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this <i>apologia</i>, Priestley gives the reins to his
imagination, or rather he allows phlogiston to drive the
halting, ambling thing for him, with the result that he
utterly loses his way and is eventually landed into an
impassable quagmire. It is not too much to say that not
one of the &ldquo;Queries, Speculations and Hints&rdquo; with
which the volume closes has stood the test of time.</p>
<p>The second volume, which made its appearance
towards the end of 1775, is dedicated to Sir John
Pringle, at that time President of the Royal Society. It
opens, as usual, with a somewhat prolix but characteristic
preface. But to his biographer Priestley&rsquo;s prefaces
are not the least interesting or valuable of his literary
productions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a preface,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;authors have always claimed a
right of saying whatever they pleased concerning themselves,
and not to lose this right it must now and then be exercised.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this respect Priestley has championed the prerogatives
of authors for all time. This particular
preface begins with an expression of self-laudation for
the little delay the writer made in putting the first
volume to the press.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In consequence of this considerable discoveries have been
made by people of distant nations; and this branch of science,
of which nothing, in a manner, was known till very lately,
indeed now bids fair to be farther advanced than any other
in the whole compass of natural philosophy.... And it will
not now be thought very assuming to say that by working in a
tub of water or a basin of quicksilver we may perhaps discover
principles of more extensive influence than even that of <i>gravity</i>
itself, the discovery of which, in its full extent, contributed so
much to immortalise the name of Newton.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Having been the means of bringing so many champions
into the field, I shall, with peculiar pleasure, attend to all their
achievements, in order to prepare myself, as I promised in
the preface to my last volume, for writing the <i>history</i> of the
campaign.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a delightfully <i>na&iuml;ve</i> compliment to his own
ability as an accumulator of facts, and to his merits as
an &ldquo;instrument in the hands of Divine Providence ...
concerning which I threw out some further hints in my
former preface, which the excellent French translator
was not permitted to insert in his version,&rdquo; he advances
this testimony to his impartiality as an historian:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I even think that I may flatter myself so much, if it be
any flattery, as to say that there is not, in the whole compass
of philosophical writing, a history of experiments so truly
<i>ingenuous</i> as mine, and especially the section on the discovery
of dephlogisticated air, which I will venture to exhibit as a
model of the kind. I am not conscious to myself of having
concealed the least hint that was suggested to me by any person
whatever, any kind of assistance that has been given me, or any
views or hypotheses by which the experiments were directed,
whether they were verified by the result or not.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is much else in the preface that might be
quoted as illustrative of the character and mental
attributes of its author. Priestley, the natural philosopher,
never forgot that he was a minister of religion,
and that to him theology was the greatest and most important
of all the sciences, and he cannot forbear even, in
what he intended to be a scientific disquisition on purely
natural phenomena, from inculcating his belief in the
divine origin of Christianity and his opinion concerning
the doctrine of purgatory and the worship of the dead.</p>
<p>The first chapter is concerned with the discovery of
what its author called <i>Vitriolic Acid Air</i>, but which we
now know as sulphur dioxide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Priestley imagined that as the liquid marine acid&mdash;that
is hydrochloric acid&mdash;readily yielded an &ldquo;air&rdquo; on heating
it might be that vitriolic acid, or oil of vitriol, would
also afford a characteristic &ldquo;air&rdquo; when treated in a
similar manner. Acting upon a suggestion of Mr Lane
he heated oil of vitriol with olive oil, when he readily
obtained a new species of air, which he collected over
mercury as he &ldquo;had been used to do it with the marine
acid air; and the whole process was as pleasing and as
elegant.&rdquo; Priestley at once surmised that the olive oil
worked by transferring its phlogiston to the vitriolic
acid, and he naturally concluded that any substance
rich in phlogiston would bring about the same result.
He next tried charcoal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I put some bits of charcoal into my phial instead of the
oil or other inflammable matter which I had used before, and
applying the flame of a candle I presently found that the
vitriolic acid air was produced as well as in the former process,
and in several respects more conveniently, the production of air
being equable, whereby the disagreeable effect of a sudden
explosion is avoided.... Finding that a great variety of
substances containing phlogiston enabled the oil of vitriol
to throw out a permanent acid air, I had some suspicion that
mere <i>heat</i> might do the same, but I did not find that there was
any foundation for that suspicion.... But though I got no
air from the oil of vitriol by this process, air was produced
at the same time in a manner that I little expected, and I
paid pretty dearly for the discovery it occasioned. Despairing
to get any air from the longer application of my candles,
I withdrew them, but before I could disengage the phial
from the vessel of quicksilver a little of it passed through
the tube into the hot acid, when instantly it was all filled
with dense white fumes, a prodigious quantity of air was
generated, the tube through which it was transmitted was
broken into many pieces, and part of the hot acid being
spilled upon my hand burned it terribly, so that the effect of
it is visible to this day. The inside of the phial was coated
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
with a white saline substance, and the smell that issued from
it was extremely suffocating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This accident taught me what I am surprised I should not
have suspected before, viz., that some <i>metals</i> will part with their
phlogiston to hot oil of vitriol, and thereby convert it into a
permanent elastic air, producing the very same effect with oil,
charcoal, or any other inflammable substance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not discouraged by the disagreeable accident above mentioned,
the next day I put a little <i>quicksilver</i> into the phial
with the ground stopple and tube, along with the oil of vitriol,
when, long before it was boiling hot, air issued plentifully from
it, and being received in a vessel of quicksilver appeared to be
genuine vitriolic acid air, exactly like that which I had procured
before, being readily imbibed by water and extinguishing
a candle in the same manner as the other had done....</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this I repeated the experiment with several other
metals.... Copper treated in the same manner yielded air
very freely, with about the same degree of heat that quicksilver
had required, and the air continued to be generated with very
little application of more heat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The theory apart, this paper is as important as these
on ammonia and the marine acid air, and exhibits
Priestley at his best. The observations he makes concerning
the main properties of the new gas and its
solubility in water, its inability to burn and to support
flame, its heaviness, its power to unite with ammonia, to
be absorbed by charcoal and to liquefy camphor, are
all accurate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Having hit upon a method of exhibiting some of the acids
in the form of air, nothing could be easier than to extend this
process to the rest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly he attempted to procure what he called
the <i>vegetable acid air</i> by heating &ldquo;exceedingly strong
concentrated acid of vinegar,&rdquo; and states that he
succeeded in obtaining an air which extinguished the
flame of a candle and was soluble in water. The paper
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
is very short and is full of contradictions. In reality, as
he subsequently found, he was dealing with vinegar
largely adulterated with oil of vitriol. The &ldquo;vegetable
acid air&rdquo; had no real existence.</p>
<p>The next paper in the series is the most important of
the whole, and the one of all others that has contributed
most largely to Priestley&rsquo;s reputation. It is entitled
&ldquo;Of Dephlogisticated Air, and of the Constitution of
the Atmosphere,&rdquo; and deals with the discovery of
oxygen. It begins in the following characteristic
fashion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The contents of this section will furnish a very striking
illustration of the truth of a remark which I have more than
once made in my philosophical writings, and which can hardly
be too often repeated, as it tends greatly to encourage philosophical
investigations, viz., that more is owing to what we
call <i>chance</i>&mdash;that is, philosophically speaking, to the observation
of <i>events arising from unknown causes</i> than to any proper
<i>design</i> or preconceived <i>theory</i> in this business. This does not
appear in the works of those who write <i>synthetically</i> upon these
subjects, but would, I doubt not, appear very strikingly in
those who are the most celebrated for their philosophical
acumen did they write <i>analytically</i> and ingenuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my own part, I will frankly acknowledge that at the
commencement of the experiments recited in this section I was
so far from having formed any hypothesis that led to the discoveries
I made in pursuing them that they would have appeared
very improbable to me had I been told of them; and when the
decisive facts did at length obtrude themselves upon my notice
it was very slowly, and with great hesitation, that I yielded to
the evidence of my senses. And yet, when I reconsider the
matter, and compare my last discoveries relating to the constitution
of the atmosphere with the first, I see the closest and the
easiest connection in the world between them, so as to wonder
that I should not have been led immediately from the one to
the other. That this was not the case I attribute to the force
of prejudice which, unknown to ourselves, biases not only our
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
<i>judgments</i>, properly so called, but even the perceptions of our
senses; for we may take a maxim so strongly for granted that
the plainest evidence of sense will not entirely change, and often
hardly modify, our persuasions; and the more ingenious a man
is, the more effectually he is entangled in his errors, his ingenuity
only helping him to deceive himself by evading the force of
truth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then points out that there are few maxims in
philosophy that have laid firmer hold upon the mind
than that air, meaning atmospherical air ... is a <i>simple
elementary substance</i>, indestructible and unalterable, at
least as much so as water was supposed to be. Priestley,
in the course of his inquiries, was soon satisfied that
atmospherical air was not an unalterable thing; that
bodies burning in it, and animals breathing it and various
other chemical processes, so far alter and deprive it
as to render it altogether unfit for the purposes to
which it is subservient; and he had discovered methods,
particularly the process of vegetation, which tended to
restore it to its original purity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I own I had no idea of the possibility of
going any further in this way and thereby procuring air purer
than the best common air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As this paper is one of the classics of chemistry, as
well as the chief corner-stone in the monument which
Priestley erected to himself, it is necessary to examine
it, as well as certain other papers which grew immediately
out of it, in some degree of detail.</p>
<p>After a reference to a hypothesis of the origin and
constitution of the atmosphere which occurs among the
&ldquo;Queries, Speculations and Hints&rdquo; above referred to, and
which is on a par with much in Priestley&rsquo;s speculations,
he proceeds to relate the circumstances which more
immediately led to the most important of all his discoveries.
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
It was the accident of possessing a burning
lens of &ldquo;considerable force,&rdquo; for want of which he
could not possibly make many of the experiments that
he had projected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But having afterwards procured a lens of twelve inches
diameter and twenty inches focal distance, I proceeded with
great alacrity to examine, by the help of it, what kind of air
a great variety of substances, natural and factitious, would yield,
putting them into vessels [short, wide, round-bottomed phials],
which I filled with quicksilver and kept inverted in a basin
of the same. Mr Warltire, a good chemist, and lecturer
in Natural Philosophy, happening to be at that time in
Calne, I explained my views to him, and was furnished by
him with many substances, which I could not otherwise have
procured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this apparatus, after a variety of other experiments,
an account of which will be found in its proper place on the
1st August 1774, I endeavoured to extract air from <i>mercurius
calcinatus per se</i>;<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> and I presently found that, by means of this
lens, air was expelled from it very readily. Having got about
three or four times as much as the bulk of my materials, I
admitted water to it, and found that it was not imbibed by it.
But what surprised me more than I can well express was that
a candle burned in this air with a remarkably vigorous flame,
very much like that enlarged flame with which a candle burns
in nitrous air exposed to iron or liver of sulphur,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> but as I had
got nothing like this remarkable appearance from any kind of
air besides this particular modification of nitrous air, and I knew
no nitrous acid was used in the preparation of mercurius
calcinatus, I was utterly at a loss how to account for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case also, though I did not give sufficient attention
to the circumstance at that time, the flame of the candle,
besides being larger, burned with more splendour and heat
than in that species of nitrous air; and a piece of red-hot wood
sparkled in it, exactly like paper dipped in a solution of nitre,
and it consumed very fast; an experiment which I had never
thought of trying with nitrous air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time that I made the above-mentioned experiment
I extracted a quantity of air with the very same property
from the common <i>red precipitate</i><a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> which, being produced by a
solution of mercury in spirit of nitre (nitric acid), made me
conclude that this peculiar property, being similar to that of
the modification of nitrous air above mentioned, depended
upon something being communicated to it by the nitrous acid;
and since the <i>mercurius calcinatus</i> is produced by exposing
mercury to a certain degree of heat, where common air has
access to it, I likewise concluded that this substance had
collected something of <i>nitre</i>, in that state of heat, from the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, however, appearing to me much more extraordinary
than it ought to have done, I entertained some suspicion that
the mercurius calcinatus on which I had made my experiments,
being bought at a common apothecary&rsquo;s, might, in fact, be
nothing more than red precipitate; though, had I been anything
of a practical chemist, I could not have entertained any
such suspicion. However, mentioning this suspicion to Mr
Warltire, he furnished me with some that he had kept for a
specimen of the preparation, and which, he told me, he could
warrant to be genuine. This being treated in the same manner
as the former, only by a longer continuance of heat, I extracted
much more air from it than from the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This experiment might have satisfied any moderate sceptic;
but, however, being at Paris in the October following, and
knowing that there were several very eminent chemists in that
place, I did not omit the opportunity, by means of my friend
Mr Magellan, to get an ounce of mercurius calcinatus prepared
by Mr Cadet, of the genuineness of which there could not
possibly be any suspicion; and at the same time I frequently
mentioned my surprise at the kind of air which I had got
from this preparation to Mr Lavoisier, Mr le Roy, and several
other philosophers, who honoured me with their notice in
that city, and who, I daresay, cannot fail to recollect the
circumstance.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last remark is significant in reference to a claim
which was subsequently put forward that the real
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
discoverer of oxygen was Lavoisier, and that he obtained
it by heating mercuric oxide.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Priestley also obtained the same air from <i>red lead</i>,
which, he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;confirmed me more in my suspicion that the <i>mercurius
calcinatus</i> must get the property of yielding this kind of air
from the atmosphere, the process by which that preparation
and this of red lead is made being similar. As I never make
the least secret of anything that I observe, I mentioned this
experiment also, as well as those with the mercurius calcinatus
and the red precipitate, to all my philosophical acquaintance
at Paris and elsewhere, having no idea, at that time, to what
these remarkable facts would lead.&rdquo; [Nitrous oxide.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley, on his return to England, made an experiment
with Cadet&rsquo;s preparation, which he found to
behave precisely like that he had procured from
Warltire. He observed that the new gas was only
sparingly soluble in water and that its power of causing
a candle to burn with a strong flame was in nowise
diminished by agitation with water&mdash;facts which he said
convinced him</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;that there must be a very material difference between the
constitution of the air from mercurius calcinatus and that of
phlogisticated nitrous air, [nitrous oxide] notwithstanding their
resemblance in some particulars.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not, however, until the following March (1775)
(he having meanwhile been intent upon his experiments
on the vitriolic air [sulphur dioxide]), that he ascertained
the real nature of the new air, and was led
&ldquo;though very gradually ... to the complete discovery
of the constitution of the air we breathe.&rdquo; By trials
with the nitrous air and with mice he found that the
new gas was eminently fit for respiration: nitrous air
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
reduced its volume to a greater extent than in the case
of common air, and a mouse lived longer in it than it
would in the same volume of common air.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking of this extraordinary fact upon my pillow, the
next morning I put another measure of nitrous air to the same
mixture, and to my utter astonishment found that it was
farther diminished to almost one-half of its original quantity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley now utterly missed his way for a time.
He sought to get the new air from the various oxides
of lead, but the fetish of phlogiston again led him
wrong, and eventually by a train of reasoning which is
fully set forth in the paper, but which need not here
be repeated, there remained, he says, no doubt in his
mind</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;but that <i>atmospherical air</i>, or the thing that we breathe,
<i>consists of the nitrous acid and earth</i>, with so much phlogiston
as is necessary to its elasticity; and likewise so much more as
is required to bring it from its state of perfect purity to the
mean condition in which we find it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s &ldquo;complete discovery of the constitution of
the air we breathe&rdquo; was thus wholly erroneous: he
was very far indeed from having a clear conception of
its real nature.</p>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s description of the main properties of
oxygen is however accurate, and lecturers in chemistry
are indebted to him for some striking experimental
illustrations of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I easily conjectured,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that inflammable air would
explode with more violence and a louder report by the help
of dephlogisticated than of common air; but the effect far
exceeded my expectations, and it has never failed to surprise
every person before whom I have made the experiment....
The dipping of a lighted candle into a jar filled with
dephlogisticated air is alone a very beautiful experiment. The
strength and vivacity of the flame is striking, and the heat
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
produced by the flame in these circumstances is also remarkably
great.... Nothing would be easier than to augment the
force of fire to a prodigious degree by blowing it with
dephlogisticated air instead of common air.... Possibly
<i>platina</i> might be melted by means of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the greater strength and vivacity of the flame of a
candle, in this pure air, it may be conjectured that it might be
peculiarly salutary to the lungs in certain morbid cases....
But perhaps we may also infer from these experiments that
though pure dephlogisticated air might be very useful as a
<i>medicine</i>, it might not be so proper for us in the usual healthy
state of the body: for, as a candle burns out much faster in
dephlogisticated than in common air, so we might, as may be
said, <i>live out too fast</i>, and the animal powers be too soon
exhausted in this pure kind of air. A moralist, at least, may
say that the air which Nature has provided for us is as good as
we deserve.... Who can tell but that, in time, this pure air
may become a fashionable article in luxury. Hitherto only
two mice and myself have had the privilege of breathing it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An experiment which Priestley says &ldquo;I had the
pleasure to see at Paris, in the laboratory of Mr
Lavoisier, my excellent fellow-labourer in these inquiries,
and to whom, in a variety of respects, the
philosophical part of the world has very great obligations,&rdquo;
led him into a train of inquiry upon the action of nitric
acid upon a wide range of organic substances, from
which however no general results followed, in spite of
much experimenting. He had at one time the idea
that a fundamental difference existed in the behaviour
of animal and vegetable matter with respect to nitric
acid, but the observations were contradictory, and
although it is readily possible to interpret the phenomena
in the light of our present knowledge, they led Priestley
to no definite conclusions.</p>
<p>Of more importance is the work on the &ldquo;Fluor Acid
Air&rdquo;&mdash;a substance discovered by &ldquo;Mr Scheele, a Swede;
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
from which circumstance the acid is often distinguished
by the name of the <i>Swedish acid</i>.&rdquo; Priestley sought to
make the air by heating Derbyshire spar (fluor spar)
with oil of vitriol in glass vessels,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;as in the process of making spirit of nitre from saltpetre;
and the most remarkable facts that have been observed concerning
it are, that the vessels in which the distillation is made
are apt to be corroded; so that holes will be made quite
through them; and that when there is water in the recipient,
the surface of it will be covered with a crust of a friable stony
matter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Priestley actually produced by this method of
experimenting was more or less pure <i>silicon fluoride</i>,
which he proceeded to collect, in his usual fashion,
over quicksilver.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I had no sooner produced this new kind of air but I was
eager to see the effect it would have on <i>water</i>, and to produce
the stony crust formed by their union, as described by Mr
Scheele; and I was not disappointed in my expectations.
The moment the water came into contact with this air the
surface of it became white and opaque by a <i>stony film</i>....
Few philosophical experiments exhibit a more pleasing appearance
than this, which can only be made by first producing the
air confined by quicksilver, and then admitting a large body
of water to it. Most persons to whom I have shown the
experiment have been exceedingly struck with it.... The
union of this acid air and water may also be exhibited in
another manner, which to some persons makes a still more
striking experiment, <i>viz.</i>, by admitting the air, as fast as it is
generated, to a large body of water resting on quicksilver....
It is, then, very pleasing to observe that the moment
any bubble of air, after passing through the quicksilver, reaches
the water, it is instantly, as it were, converted into a stone;
but continuing hollow for a short space of time, generally
rises to the top of the water.... I have met with few
persons who are soon weary of looking at it; and some could
sit by it almost a whole hour, and be agreeably amused all
the time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s attempts to explain the real nature of the
<i>fluor acid air</i> were, as may be expected, not very happy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These appearances I explain by supposing that the
vitriolic acid, in uniting with the spar, is in part volatilised by
means of some phlogiston contained in it, so as to form a
vitriolic acid air; and there is also combined with this air a
portion of the solid earthy part of the spar, which continues
in a state of solution till, coming into contact with the water,
the fluid unites with the acid, and the earth is precipitated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third volume of the work was published in the
early part of 1777, with a dedication to Lord Stanhope.
It opens, as usual, with the characteristically discursive
preface, extending to thirty pages, in which the author
apologises for the character of much in the volume.
He is constrained to admit that numerous as his <i>facts</i>
are, &ldquo;few of them will appear so brilliant in the eye of
the <i>general scholar</i>&rdquo; as in either of the two former
volumes, although he trusts they will &ldquo;be thought no
less valuable by philosophers and chemists.&rdquo; Priestley,
it would seem, was conscious that he was beginning, as
the phrase goes, &ldquo;to write himself out.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Lest my readers should be alarmed at this addition of one
volume after another on the same subject, I do assure them
that I shall now certainly give them and myself some respite,
and deliver the torch to anyone who may be disposed to
carry it, foreseeing that my attention will be sufficiently
engaged by speculations of a very different nature.... It
will be a great satisfaction to me, after the part that I have
taken in this business, to be a <i>spectator</i> of its future progress,
when I see the work in so many and so good hands, and
everything in so rapid and so promising a way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On taking leave of this subject I would entreat the candour
and indulgence of my readers for any oversights they may
discover in me as a <i>philosopher</i>, or imperfections as a <i>writer</i>. I
am far from pretending to infallibility; but I have the satisfaction
to reflect that, imperfect as my works may be found
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
to be, they are each as perfect as I was able to make
them....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon this, as upon other occasions, I can only repeat that
it is not my <i>opinions</i> on which I would be understood to lay
any stress. Let the <i>new facts</i>, from which I deduce them, be
considered as my <i>discoveries</i>, and let other persons draw better
inferences from them if they can. This is a new and a wide
field of experiment and speculation, and a premature attachment
to hypothesis is the greatest obstruction we are likely to meet
with in our progress through it; and as I think I have been
pretty much upon my guard myself, I would caution others to
be upon their guard too.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These passages evidently were written under the
influence of the feeling of resentment with which he
viewed the criticism to which his speculations were
subjected abroad. Fontana, Lavoisier and others were,
indeed, zealously engaged in using Priestley&rsquo;s own <i>facts</i>
to destroy the conception by which he explained them.
An appeal to the balance was felt to be necessary, and
Priestley, as a logician, could not resist it. But he was
no quantitative chemist: the habits of a Cavendish were
quite foreign to his genius: patient, scrupulous attention
to numerical accuracy was not one of his characteristics:
he was one of the most industrious of
experimenters&mdash;delighting, indeed, in manipulation for
the mere sake of it, but withal hasty and superficial.
It is nowhere evident in his writings that his problems
were attacked according to any carefully-thought-out
plan. He confesses indeed, on more than one occasion,
he tested the inflammability of one of his numerous
&ldquo;airs&rdquo; <i>because</i> he had a lighted candle near him: had the
candle not been lighted it would not have occurred to
him to do it. Priestley was, in fact, a pioneer: he
showed the existence of a new world for science, and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
himself roamed over a portion of it, like a second
Joshua; but he had not the experience or the aptitude
to accurately map out even that fraction.</p>
<p>There is little in the third volume of permanent
value. It is largely an account of a series of disconnected
observations on the action of nitric acid upon a variety
of substances, which, however, led to no general conclusions.
It is, however, certain that if Priestley could
have induced himself to follow up certain of his observations
he would have arrived at <i>facts</i> of far greater
importance than those he actually narrates. &ldquo;<i>Speculation</i>,&rdquo;
he said, by way of rejoinder to Lavoisier,
&ldquo;is a cheap commodity. <i>New and important facts</i> are
most wanted, and therefore of most value,&rdquo; and the new
and important facts were within his grasp if he had only
reached out for them.</p>
<p>Another portion of the work is concerned with
supplementary observations on the gases treated of in
the preceding volumes, partly by way of correction and
partly additional. Here and there we have a suggestive
passage, as in the paper on &ldquo;Experiments on the Mixture
of Different Kinds of Air that have no Mutual Action,&rdquo; in
which he thus clearly indicates the principle of the intra-diffusion
of gases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The result of my trials has been this general conclusion:
that when two kinds of air have been mixed it is not possible
to separate them again by any method of <i>decanting</i> or pouring
them off, though the greatest possible care be taken in doing it.
They may not properly <i>incorporate</i>, so as to form a <i>third species
of air</i>, possessed of new properties; but they will remain
equally diffused through the mass of each other; and whether
it be the upper or the lower part of the air that is taken out of the
vessel, without disturbing the rest, it will contain an equal
mixture of them both.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Another suggestive paper is on &ldquo;Respiration and the
Use of the Blood,&rdquo; which was read to the Royal Society
on January 25, 1776, and appears in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i>,
vol. lxvi. Priestley, of course, regarded respiration as
a <i>phlogistic process</i>, and &ldquo;that the use of the lungs is to
carry off a putrid <i>effluvium</i>, or to discharge that
phlogiston, which had been taken into the system with
the aliment, and has become, as it were, <i>effete</i>, the air
that is respired serving as a menstruum for that
purpose.&rdquo; This he thinks he has &ldquo;proved to be effected
by means of the <i>blood</i>, in consequence of its coming so
nearly into contact with the air in the lungs, the blood
appearing to be a fluid wonderfully formed to imbibe
and part with that principle which the chemists call
phlogiston, and changing its colour in consequence of
being charged with it or being freed from it.&rdquo; The
<i>facts</i> in this paper are for the most part correctly stated,
but the discoverer of oxygen led the world woefully
astray as to the part played by that gas in the
phenomena of respiration.</p>
<p>The fourth volume made its appearance in March 1779,
with a dedication to Sir George Savile, who had
rendered Priestley the service of introducing him and
his invention of soda-water to the notice of the Admiralty.
In the preface, which is commendably short, he makes
some reference to the respite which he had promised
himself and his readers, but trusts, by way of extenuation,
&ldquo;it may be sufficient to allege the instability of
human purposes and pursuits.&rdquo; He had intended to
devote himself to metaphysics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But that kind of writing,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is a thing of a very
different nature from this. I can truly say ... that single sections
in this work have cost me more than whole volumes of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
other; so great is the difference between writing from the head
only and writing, as it may be called, from the hands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact was Priestley could not keep away from
his laboratory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Having acquired a fondness for experiments, even slighter
inducements than I have had would have been sufficient to
determine my conduct.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The preface is noteworthy for its plea for the position
of experimental science in the scheme of general
education.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If we wish to lay a good foundation for a philosophical
taste, and philosophical pursuits, persons should be accustomed
to the sight of experiments and processes in early life. They
should, more especially, be early initiated in the theory and
practice of <i>investigation</i>, by which many of the old discoveries
may be made to be really <i>their own</i>; on which account they
will be much more valued by them. And, in a great variety
of articles, very young persons may be made so far acquainted
with everything necessary to be previously known as to engage
(which they will do with peculiar alacrity) in pursuits truly
original.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the course of some observations on the effect &ldquo;of
impregnating oil of vitriol with nitrous acid vapour&rdquo; he
discovered <i>nitrosulphuric acid</i>, the so-called &ldquo;Leaden
Chamber Crystals,&rdquo; whose properties and behaviour
with water he describes with accuracy and even eloquence.
Of these crystals he says: &ldquo;A more beautiful
appearance can hardly be imagined, and I am afraid I
shall never see the like again.&rdquo; He also noticed the
formation of the dark brown compound which nitric
oxide forms with a solution of green vitriol, and adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To determine whether the phenomena attending the
impregnation of the solution of green vitriol with nitrous air
depended in any measure upon the seeming <i>astringency</i> of that
solution ... I impregnated a quantity of <i>green tea</i>, which is also
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
said to be astringent, with nitrous air, but no sensible change of
colour was produced in it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He several times noticed the deep blue liquid which
nitrogen peroxide forms with cold water. He made
many attempts to use nitric oxide as an antiseptic,
especially for culinary purposes. But the gastronomic
results with fowls and pigeons were not to his liking,
although he says, &ldquo;my friend Mr Magellan ... had not
so bad an opinion of this piece of cookery as I had.&rdquo; One
cannot read Priestley&rsquo;s description of his multifarious
experiments without being struck with the number of
occasions in which he just missed making discoveries of
first-rate importance. It is obvious that he had obtained
chlorine without recognising it, even before the news of
Scheele&rsquo;s discovery reached this country. He had also prepared,
without knowing it, phosphoretted hydrogen and
phosphorous acid. At times, however, he can follow a clue
with remarkable perspicacity; as in his observation of the
cause of the &ldquo;flouring&rdquo; of mercury, and in his discovery
of a method of removing lead and tin from that metal.</p>
<p>The subject of &ldquo;dephlogisticated air&rdquo; naturally continued
to interest him, and he again returns to it in this
volume, for he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As it sometimes amuses myself it may perhaps amuse others
to look back with me to the several steps in the actual progress
of this investigation, some of which I overlooked in my last
account of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He points out, as already stated, that he must have had
the new gas in his hands as far back as November 1771,
having obtained it from nitre. He admits that he had
no particular view in making his crucial experiment of
August 1, 1774,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;excepting that of extracting air from a variety of substances
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
by means of a burning lens in quicksilver, which was then a
new process with me, and which I was very fond of.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He explains how he was led to his speculation that
&ldquo;this kind of air, and consequently of atmospherical air,
which is the same thing but in a state of inferior
purity,&rdquo; consists &ldquo;of earth and spirit of nitre.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;I have since seen reason to suspect that
hypothesis, plausible as it appears. Indeed, some of my late
experiments would lead me to conclude that there is no acid at
all in pure air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then experiments with manganese, which Scheele,
who independently discovered oxygen, had already employed,
and finds that it yields the new air both when
heated alone or with oil of vitriol. The production of
oxygen from manganese was contrary to his expectations
as the substances he had hitherto used, the <i>precipitate per
se</i> and the <i>red lead</i> and the nitre, had all been subjected
to &ldquo;the influence of the atmosphere,&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;here was
pure air from a substance which for anything that appeared
had always been in the bowels of the earth, and never had
had any communication with the external air.&rdquo; This
led to the surmise that possibly the expulsion of
dephlogisticated air from such mineral substances</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;might assist in sustaining subterraneous fires.... The solution
of the phenomena of subterraneous fires would certainly be much
easier on the supposition of their supplying their own <i>pabulum</i>,
by means of dephlogisticated air contained in substances exposed
to their heat. I therefore desired Mr Landriani, who being in
Italy had a good opportunity of making inquiries on the
subject, to inform me whether any of those substances, and
particularly <i>manganese</i> be found in their volcanoes; and his
answer makes it rather probable that those fires are, in part,
sustained by this means.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ease with which nitre parts with its oxygen on
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
heating furnished Priestley with the true explanation of
its so-called &ldquo;detonation,&rdquo; &ldquo;concerning which,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;the most improbable conjectures have been advanced
by the most eminent philosophers and chemists.&rdquo;
After a reference to the hypothesis of Macquer, who
assumes that what he calls &ldquo;a <i>nitrous sulphur</i>&rdquo; is produced,
Priestley points out that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;the doctrine of dephlogisticated air supplies the easiest
solution imaginable of this very difficult phenomenon. Let
any person but attend to the phenomena of the detonation of
charcoal in nitre, and that of dipping a piece of hot charcoal
into a jar of dephlogisticated air, and I think it will be impossible
for him not to conclude that the appearances are the
very same and must have the same cause.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of all the quantitative exercises performed by
Priestley, by far the most numerous depended upon his
application of nitric oxide to measure the &ldquo;goodness&rdquo;
of air.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I first discovered the property of nitrous
air as a test of the wholesomeness of common air, I flattered
myself that it might be of considerable practical use, and
particularly that the air of distant places and countries might be
brought and examined together with great ease and satisfaction;
but I own that hitherto I have rather been disappointed in my
expectations from it.... I gave several of my friends the
trouble to send me air from distant places, especially from
manufacturing towns, and the worst they could find to be
actually breathed by the manufacturers, such as is known to be
exceedingly offensive to those who visit them; but when I
examined those specimens of air in Wiltshire, the difference
between them and the very best air in this county, which is
esteemed to be very good, as also the difference between them
and specimens of the best air in the counties in which these
manufacturing towns are situated, was very trifling.... I have
frequently taken the open air in the most exposed places in this
country at <i>different times of the year</i>, and in different states of
the <i>weather</i>, etc., but never found the difference so great as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
inaccuracy arising from the method of making the trial might
easily amount to or exceed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other observers, less careful or more sanguine than
Priestley, were, however, successful in detecting the
differences which prejudice led them to anticipate.
Thus Signor Marsilio Landriani of Milan, whose name
has already been mentioned in connection with the
theory of subterraneous fires, in the course of a tour
through Italy had the satisfaction of convincing himself</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;that the air of all those places, which from the long experience
of the inhabitants has been reputed unwholesome, is
found to be so to a very great degree of exactness by the
<i>eudiometer</i>.... The air of the Pontine lakes, that of the
Sciroccho at Rome (so very unwholesome), that of the
Campagna Romana, of the Grotto del Cane, of the Zolfatara
at Naples, of the baths of Nero at Baja, of the seacoast of
Tuscany, were all examined by me and found to be in such a
state as daily experience led me to expect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern eudiometry, making use of methods of far
greater precision than were possible to Priestley, has
confirmed his supposition that atmospheric air is remarkably
constant in composition, and that its wholesomeness
depends upon other causes than the relative
amount of the dephlogisticated air contained in it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important of the many papers contained
in this volume are those which relate to the
&ldquo;Melioration of Air by the Growth of Plants,&rdquo; a subject
to which Priestley gave attention, even whilst at Leeds,
in 1771. In these papers he clearly proves that this
&ldquo;melioration&rdquo; is connected with the green matter of
leaves and that it is dependent upon sunlight. This
observation is of fundamental importance and attracted
much attention.</p>
<p>In the fifth volume, which was published in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
spring of 1781, with a dedication to Dr Heberden,
when Priestley had moved to Birmingham, he again
returns to this subject. Practically all the experimental
work to which it relates was done whilst he was with
Lord Shelburne, and mainly at Calne. During the
former parts of the summer of 1780 he suffered from
an illness which greatly interfered with his work,
although he thinks that during his incapacity for
making experiments his &ldquo;hints for the farther prosecution
of them are greatly accumulated.&rdquo; It cannot be
said that the five papers on the relations of vegetation
to air, with which the volume opens, added very
materially to the fundamental fact which Priestley had
discovered. They furnished, however, additional
evidence of it and no doubt stimulated further inquiry.
If his facts could not be controverted, his explanations
and surmises were at least open to attack, and a number of
observers, both here and abroad, busied themselves with
the problems of physiological botany thereby suggested.</p>
<p>As regards the subject of &ldquo;air&rdquo; in general,
although a large number of isolated observations are
recorded in somewhat tedious detail, no new fact of
first-rate importance is apparent. The experiments are
largely supplementary to those in the preceding volumes
and are for the most explanatory or corroborative of
them. Perhaps the most important are those dealing
with &ldquo;the production of nitrous air in which a candle
will burn,&rdquo; by which is signified the gas we now know
as nitrous oxide, but which Priestley eventually termed
<i>dephlogisticated nitrous air</i>. The process he employed is
no longer used in the production of this gas, but it
sufficed in his hands to determine its individuality without
doubt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s methods of experiment with his various
&ldquo;airs&rdquo; were very uniform. He tried their solubility in
water, their power of supporting or extinguishing flame,
whether they were respirable, how they behaved with
acid and alkaline air, and with nitric oxide and inflammable
air, and lastly how they were affected by
the electric spark. He occasionally made attempts to
weigh them, but his determinations of their relative
density were altogether untrustworthy. Indeed, it is
evident from the terms in which he speaks of these
efforts that he was conscious of their inadequacy. The
result of submitting alkaline air (ammonia) to the
electric spark, whereby it is resolved into nitrogen and
hydrogen, surprised him not a little.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are few experiments the <i>rationale</i> of which I less
pretend to understand than the production of genuine and
permanent inflammable air from alkaline air by means of the
electric spark.... One query on this subject is, whence
comes the phlogiston, which is certainly a principal ingredient
in the constitution of inflammable air. Alkaline air, indeed,
contains phlogiston, because in the manner in which I have
generally produced it, it is itself partially inflammable; but it
is not nearly so much so as the inflammable air which is
produced by means of it. Besides, it will appear by the
following experiments that the quantity of the inflammable air
far exceeds that of the alkaline.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Priestley clearly recognised the production
of the inflammable air, &ldquo;in no respect to be distinguished
from that which is extracted from metals by
acids,&rdquo; and inferred it must come from the alkaline air
(&ldquo;the production having its limits&rdquo;), he failed to detect
the other constituent of ammonia. His determination
of the actual increase in volume was inaccurate, and his
attempt to explain the phenomenon wholly fallacious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>At the instigation of Mr Woulfe, whose name
mainly lives in connection with a useful piece of
chemical apparatus, Priestley was encouraged to hope
that he would</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;find something remarkable in the solution of <i>manganese</i> in
spirit of salt. Mr Woulfe, however, in a very friendly
manner, at the same time, cautioned me with respect of the
vapour that would issue from it, as from his own experience
he apprehended it was of a very dangerous nature.... I
cannot say that it was the apprehension of danger, but rather
having other things in view, that prevented my giving much
attention to the subject.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley&rsquo;s experiments led to no decisive result: he
of course recognised the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;peculiar smell, exactly resembling that which is procured by
dissolving <i>red lead</i> in the same acids.... On the application of
heat it was easy to perceive that air, or vapour, was expelled;
but it was instantly seized by the quicksilver.... This is a
new field that is yet before me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley never occupied that field. It is tolerably
certain that both Woulfe and he had unknowingly prepared
<i>chlorine gas</i>, but the glory of its discovery belongs
to Scheele.</p>
<p>The paper &ldquo;Of Sound in Different Kinds of Air&rdquo; is
worth quoting as showing Priestley at his best:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Almost all the experiments that have hitherto been made
relating to <i>sound</i> have been made in common air, of which it
is known to be a vibration, though it is likewise known to be
capable of being transmitted by other substances. There
could be little doubt, however, of the possibility of sound
<i>originating</i> in any other kind of air, as well as being <i>transmitted</i>
by them; but the trial had not been actually made, and I had
an easy opportunity of making it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, the experiments promised to ascertain whether
the <i>intensity</i> of sound was affected by any other property of the
air in which it was made than the mere <i>density</i> of it. For
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
the different kinds of air in which I was able to make the
same sound, besides differing in specific gravity, have likewise
other remarkable chemical differences, the influence of which
with respect to sound would, at the same time, be submitted to
examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being provided with a piece of clock-work, in which was
a bell, and a hammer to strike upon it (which I could cover
with a receiver, and which, when it was properly covered up,
I could set in motion by the pressure of a brass rod going
through a collar of leather), I placed it on some soft paper on a
transfer. Then taking a receiver, the top of which was closed
with a plate of brass, through which the brass rod and collar
of leathers was inserted, I placed the whole on the plate of an
air-pump, and exhausted the receiver of all the air that it
contained. Then removing this exhausted receiver, containing
the piece of clock-work, I filled it with some of those kinds
of air that are capable of being confined by water.... Then
by forcing down the brass rod through the collar of leathers
I made the hammer strike the bell, which it would do more
than a dozen times after each pressure. And the instrument
was contrived to do the same thing many times successively
after being once wound up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything being thus prepared, I had nothing to do, after
filling the same receiver with each of the kinds of air in its
turn, but receding from the apparatus, while an assistant
produced the sound, to observe at what distance I could
distinctly hear it. The result of all my observations, as far
as I could judge, was that the intensity of sound depends
solely upon the <i>density</i> of the air in which it is made, and not
at all upon any chemical principle in its constitution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In inflammable air the sound of the bell was hardly to be
distinguished from the same in a pretty good vacuum; and
this air is ten times rarer than common air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fixed air the sound was much louder than in common
air, so as to be heard about half as far again; and this air is
in about the same proportion denser than common air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In dephlogisticated air the sound was also sensibly louder
than in common air, and, as I thought, rather more than in
the proportion of its superior density; but of this I cannot
pretend to be quite sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;In all these experiments the common standard was the
sound of the same bell in the same receiver, every other circumstance
also being the same; the air only being changed by
removing the receiver from the transfer and blowing through
it, etc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sixth and last volume appeared in 1786 with a
dedication to William Constable, Esq., of Barton Constable.</p>
<p>In the preface Priestley is concerned to defend himself
against the charge that he occupies himself too
much with Theology to the detriment of Natural Philosophy.
Theology, he pleads, is his original and proper
province, and for which, therefore, he may be allowed
to have a justifiable predilection. But as with Metaphysics,
so with Theology. Neither subject engrossed
so much of his time as some persons imagined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am particularly complained of at present as having
thrown away so much time on the composition of my <i>History
of the Corruptions of Christianity</i>, and of the <i>Opinions Concerning
Christ</i>. But I can assure them, and the nature of the thing,
if they consider it, may satisfy them, that the time I must
necessarily have bestowed upon the experiments, of which an
account is contained in this single volume, is much more than
I have given to the <i>six</i>, of which the above-mentioned works
consist, and to all the controversial pieces that I have written
in defence of the former of them. The labour and attention
necessary to enable me to write single paragraphs in this work
have been more than was requisite to compose whole sections
or chapters of the former.... Besides, these different
studies so relieve one another that I believe I do more in each
of them, by applying to them alternately, than I should do if
I gave my whole attention to one of them only.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Priestley&rsquo;s main defence rests &ldquo;on the superior
dignity and importance of <i>theological studies</i> to any other
whatever.&rdquo; The whole preface must be read in the
light of Priestley&rsquo;s altered circumstances and of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
relations to the theological world, which, since his
removal to Birmingham, had greatly increased in weight
and importance. As already stated, he regarded himself
as ordained to champion the cause of religion
among the persons to whom his writings as a natural
philosopher specially appealed. The author of the
<i>Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion</i> was the writer
of the <i>Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever</i> and, in an age
of unbelief, the doughty antagonist of Gibbon. Otherwise
the incongruous mixture of Theology and Natural
Philosophy, of which the preface is made up, seems
inexplicable.</p>
<p>To the historian of chemistry the last volume of the
series is hardly less interesting than any one of its
predecessors, not so much as affording knowledge of
new &ldquo;airs&rdquo; as by reason of Priestley&rsquo;s relation to the
waning doctrine of phlogiston, and on account of the
part that his own work was playing, in spite of himself,
in completing its overthrow. The volume indeed
significantly opens with &ldquo;Experiments relating to
Phlogiston,&rdquo; a reprint with notes of his paper in the
73rd volume of the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>. Priestley
truly says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are few subjects, perhaps none, that have occasioned
more perplexity to chemists than that of <i>phlogiston</i>, or, as it is
sometimes called, the principle <i>of inflammability</i>. It was the
great discovery of <span class="sc">Stahl</span> that this principle, whatever it be,
is transferable from one substance to another, how different
soever in their other properties, such as sulphur, wood, and all
the metals, and therefore is the same thing in them all. But
what has given an air of mystery to this subject has been
that it was imagined that this principle, or substance, could
not be exhibited except in combination with other substances,
and could not be made to assume separately either a fluid or
solid form. It was also asserted by some that phlogiston was
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
so far from adding to the weight of bodies that the addition
of it made them really lighter than they were before; on
which account they chose to call it <i>the principle of levity</i>.
This opinion had great patrons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of late it has been the opinion of many celebrated
chemists, Mr Lavoisier among others, that the whole doctrine
of phlogiston has been founded on mistake, and that in all
cases in which it was thought that bodies parted with the
principle of phlogiston, they in fact lost nothing, but on the
contrary acquired something; and in most cases an addition of
some kind of air; that a <i>metal</i>, for instance, was not a combination
of two things, viz., an <i>earth</i> and <i>phlogiston</i>, but was
probably a simple substance in its metallic state; and that the
calx is produced not by the loss of phlogiston, or of anything
else, but by the acquisition of air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to say that the arguments in favour
of this opinion, especially those which were drawn from
the experiments of Lavoisier on mercury, were &ldquo;so
specious&rdquo; that he owns he was much inclined to adopt
it. But he was evidently loth to part company with a
conception which had hitherto been the central idea of
his chemical creed, the very key-stone of the structure
which he was pleased to regard as his philosophy. As
an abstract conception, as the principle of levity, as
something which was the negation of mass and which
gravity repelled, phlogiston was eminently unsatisfactory.
But what if phlogiston were an entity? A ponderable
substance, no matter how light? In that case Stahl&rsquo;s
generalisation might still afford salvation. &ldquo;My friend,
Mr Kirwan&rdquo;&mdash;a clever, ingenious Irishman, with a
nimble wit and a facile pen&mdash;supplied the hint&mdash;&ldquo;Phlogiston
was inflammable air&rdquo;&mdash;and Priestley by
a series of experiments, faultless as to execution but
utterly fallacious as to interpretation, persuades himself
that Kirwan is right and that Mr Lavoisier&rsquo;s opinion
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
and his &ldquo;specious arguments&rdquo; are therefore to be
discountenanced. The paper, in certain respects, is one
of the most noteworthy of Priestley&rsquo;s productions. The
experiments are original, ingenious and striking, but as
an example of his inductive capacity, or as an indication
of its author&rsquo;s logical power, or of his ability to try
judicially the very issue he has raised, it is significant
only of the profound truth of his own words that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;we may take a maxim so strongly for granted that the
plainest evidence of sense will not entirely change, and often
hardly modify, our persuasions; and the more ingenious a
man is, the more effectually he is entangled in his errors, his
ingenuity only helping him to deceive himself by evading
the force of truth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next paper in the volume, on &ldquo;The Seeming
Conversion of Water into Air,&rdquo; is a record of experiments
which cost Priestley much labour and the
Lunar Society, for a time, much mystification.
Priestley eventually detected the fallacy in the observation
which originally induced him to believe that it was
possible to transmute water into a permanently elastic
fluid, but he got no further in his explanation than that
air has a faculty of passing through the pores of an
earthern vessel &ldquo;by means of a power very different
from that of pressure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This and the third paper in the series are classical,
and this partly by reason of, and partly in spite of, their
blunders, for they are the record of the work upon
which James Watt largely based his conjectures concerning
the real chemical nature of water, whereby his
name has been associated with that of Cavendish and
Lavoisier as the true discoverer of its composition. In
the course of his inquiry Priestley studied the action of
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
steam upon red-hot iron by an arrangement generally
similar to that employed by Lavoisier, but his explanation
of the phenomena is essentially different from that
of the French chemist, as may be seen from the following
quotation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Since iron gains the same addition of weight by melting it
in <i>dephlogisticated air</i>, and also by the addition of <i>water</i> when
red-hot, and becomes, as I have already observed, in all respects
the same substance, it is evident that this air or water, as existing
in the iron, is the very same thing; and this can hardly be
explained but upon the supposition that water consists of two
kinds of air, <i>viz.</i>, inflammable and dephlogisticated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, however, is how Priestley actually does explain
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When iron is melted in dephlogisticated air we may
suppose that, though part of its phlogiston escapes to enter into
the composition of the small quantity of fixed air which is then
procured, yet enough remains to form <i>water</i> with the addition
of the dephlogisticated air which it has imbibed, so that this
<i>calx</i> of iron consists of the intimate union of the pure <i>earth of
iron</i> and of <i>water</i>; and therefore when the same calx, thus
saturated with water, is exposed to heat in inflammable air, this
air enters into it, destroys the attraction between the water and
the earth, and revives the iron while the water is expelled in its
proper form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consequently, in the process with <i>steam</i>, nothing is necessary
to be supposed but the entrance of the water and the expulsion
of the phlogiston belonging to the iron, no more phlogiston
remaining in it than what the water brought along with it, and
which is retained as a constituent part of the water or of the
new compound.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No more striking illustration of how a man&rsquo;s ingenuity
may help him to deceive himself could be given than is
afforded by this passage. Priestley to the end of his
days never got a just conception of the real chemical
constitution of water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>The remaining papers call for little comment. In the
course of some further inquiries Priestley discovered
<i>sulphuretted hydrogen</i>, termed by him <i>sulphurated inflammable
air</i>, and which he prepared by the action of oil of
vitriol upon ferrous sulphide. This gas must of course
have been frequently obtained or perceived by him, and
possibly by others, as it is produced by a number of
processes. Its characteristic smell was associated with
sulphur: it was thought to be nothing but inflammable
air modified or polluted by the accidental presence of
sulphur. It cannot be held that Priestley drew the
same sharp distinctions between the various kinds of
inflammable air that we draw to-day. To us they are
essentially different substances. Priestley, however,
regarded them as in the main phlogiston combined or
associated with other substances which affected the
character of their flames or gave them different properties.
In his opinion they were essentially the same. This
fact serves to explain what is otherwise incomprehensible,
and accounts for many of his mistakes.</p>
<p>The last paper in the volume, excluding the &ldquo;Supplementary
Observations,&rdquo; has a special interest. It is
entitled &ldquo;Observations relating to Theory,&rdquo; and is in
fact Priestley&rsquo;s Confession of Faith in the doctrine
which enslaved and misled him throughout the whole of
his scientific career. But he makes it so hesitatingly
and with so many reservations that one wonders why he
is constrained to make it at all. He appears to think,
however, that it is expected of him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is always our endeavour, after making experiments, to
generalise the conclusions we draw from them, and by this
means to form a <i>theory</i>, or <i>system of principles</i>, to which all the
facts may be reduced, and by means of which we may be able
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
to foretell the results of future experiments.... In my former
publications I have frequently promised to give such a <i>general
theory</i> of the experiments in which the different kinds of air
are concerned, as the present state of our knowledge of them
will enable me to do. But, like Simonides with respect to the
question that was proposed to him concerning God, I have
deferred it from time to time; and indeed I am more than
ever disposed to defer it still longer, as I own that I am at
present even less able to give such a theory as shall satisfy
myself than I was some years ago; new difficulties having
arisen, which unhinge former theories, and more experiments
being necessary to establish new ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fluctuating, however, as the present state of this branch of
knowledge is, I do not think that I can, on this occasion, entirely
decline giving some observations of a theoretical nature, and
though I cannot pretend to perform the whole of my promise,
I shall give a summary view of what appears to me to be the
constituent parts of all the kinds of air with which we are
acquainted, and a more particular account of the hypothesis
concerning phlogiston, which is at present more an object of
discussion than anything else of a theoretical nature.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priestley then passes in review all the &ldquo;airs&rdquo; of which
the chemistry of his time had any knowledge, giving the
<i>elements</i> or constituent principles of which he imagined
them to be composed.</p>
<p>The only kind of air that he thinks to be properly
<i>elementary</i>, and to consist of a simple substance, is
<i>dephlogisticated air</i>, with possibly the addition of the
principle of heat, which, as it is not probable that it
adds to the <i>weight</i> of bodies, can hardly be called an
<i>element</i> in their composition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dephlogisticated air appears to be one of the elements of
water, of fixed air, of all the acids, and of many other substances
which, till lately, have been thought to be simple. The
air of the atmosphere, exclusive of a great variety of foreign
impregnations, appears to consist of dephlogisticated and
phlogisticated air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>As regards <i>phlogisticated air</i>&mdash;the mephitic air of
Rutherford, the azote of Lavoisier, the nitrogen of
Chaptal&mdash;Priestley, reasoning from Cavendish&rsquo;s work,
concluded that it was probably not elementary, but
&ldquo;that it consists of nitrous acid and phlogiston; this
acid having always been produced by decomposing it
with ... dephlogisticated air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is conscious, however, of the insufficiency of this
hypothesis, and suggests</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;that the <i>acid principle</i> is supplied by the dephlogisticated
air, while the nitrous air gives the base of the nitrous acid and
phlogiston; and then this [phlogisticated] air may perhaps be
considered as phlogiston combined not with all the necessary
elements of nitrous acid, but only what may be called the base of
it, <i>viz.</i>, the dephlogisticated nitrous vapour, or something which
when united to dephlogisticated air will constitute nitrous acid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fixed air</i> (carbonic acid) seems to be a compound
of phlogiston and dephlogisticated air.&rdquo; In other words,
carbonic acid and water have, according to Priestley,
&ldquo;the same elementary composition.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is something
remarkable that two substances so different from each
other as <i>fixed air</i> and <i>water</i> should be analysed into
the same principles. But there is this difference between
them, that water is the union not of pure phlogiston but
of inflammable air and dephlogisticated air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the true nature of <i>inflammable air</i>, Priestley, as we
have more than once had occasion to point out, had only
the vaguest notions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Inflammable air,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;seems now to consist of water
and inflammable air, which however seems extraordinary, as the
two substances are hereby made to involve each other, one of
the constituent parts of water being inflammable air, and one of
the constituent parts of inflammable air being water; and
therefore, if the experiments would favour it (but I do not see
that they do so) it would be more natural to suppose that water,
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
like fixed air, consists of phlogiston and dephlogisticated air in
some different mode of combination.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Priestley to the last imagined that the various
kinds of inflammable air known to him were at bottom
one and the same substance, modified or affected by
other substances, accidental and unessential, might be
proved by a number of passages. He says with respect
to inflammable air generally:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is an astonishing variety in the different kinds of
inflammable air, the cause of which is very imperfectly known.
The lightest, and therefore, probably, the purest kind seems to
consist of phlogiston and water only. But it is probable that
<i>oil</i>, and that of different kinds, may be held in solution in several
of them, and be the reason of their burning with a lambent flame,
and also of their being so readily resolved into fixed air when
they are decomposed with dephlogisticated air; though <i>why</i>
this should be the case I cannot imagine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Nitrous air</i> (nitric oxide) he conceives to be a combination
of a dephlogisticated nitrous air and phlogiston,
and that by adding to it dephlogisticated air and water
it is converted into nitrous acid.</p>
<p><i>Dephlogisticated nitrous air</i> (nitrous oxide) he conceives
may, like dephlogisticated air, be an elementary substance
and to be formed by depriving nitrous air of its phlogiston.</p>
<p>The various <i>acid airs</i> (<i>e.g.</i>, marine acid air, vitriolic
acid air, etc.) consist of the peculiar acids as vapours
combined with phlogiston.</p>
<p>The <i>Alkaline air</i> (ammonia) he thought to consist of
inflammable air and phlogisticated air (nitrogen),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;or of something capable of being converted into phlogisticated
air.... That water enters into the composition of alkaline
air seems necessary to be admitted, because it is decomposed
into inflammable air, which I cannot help thinking necessarily
requires water. It seems, however, clearly to be inferred ... that
there is no occasion to admit the <i>alkaline principle</i> into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
number of <i>elements</i>; the <i>alkalinity</i>, as I may say, some way or
other, arising from phlogiston, or phlogisticated air, as <i>acidity</i>
arises from dephlogisticated air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After these theoretical speculations, &ldquo;in which,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;I fear I have not communicated much light,
though it is as much as I have been able to get,&rdquo;
Priestley proceeds to make some observations relating
to <i>phlogiston</i>, &ldquo;the existence of which is at present a great
subject of discussion with philosophers; some maintaining
that there is no such thing, and others holding
the doctrine of <span class="sc">Stahl</span> on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;According to <span class="sc">Stahl</span>, phlogiston is a real substance, capable
of being transferred from one body to another; its presence or
absence making a remarkable difference in the properties of
bodies, whether it add to their <i>weight</i> or not. Thus he concluded
that oil of vitriol deprived of water, and united to phlogiston,
becomes sulphur; and that the calces of metals, by the
addition of the same substance, become metals.... What is
now contended for is that in the oil of vitriol changing into
sulphur something is lost and nothing gained, and also that a
calx becomes a metal by the loss of air only. And did facts
correspond to this theory it would certainly be preferable to
that of <span class="sc">Stahl</span>, as being more simple; there being one principle
less to take into our account in explaining the changes of
bodies. But I do not know of any case in which phlogiston
has been supposed to enter into a body, but there is room to
suppose that something does enter into it....</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has been insisted upon, as most favourable to the exclusion
of phlogiston, is the revival of mercury without the addition
of any other substance from the precipitate <i>per se</i>. In this
case it is evident that mere <i>heat</i> ... is sufficient to revive the metal.
And as what is expelled from this calx is the purest dephlogisticated
air, it has been said that mercury is changed into this
calx by imbibing pure air, and therefore becomes a metal again,
merely in consequence of parting with that air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dexterous Mr Kirwan, not long before he himself
embraced the French doctrine, furnished Priestley with
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
an argument which satisfied him that this cardinal fact can
be accounted for without excluding phlogiston. &ldquo;Since
therefore the supposition is exceedingly convenient, if
not absolutely necessary, to the explanation of many other
facts in chemistry, it is at least advisable not to abandon it.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That calces do not become metals merely by parting with
the air they contain, is evident from my experiments on heating
them in contact with inflammable air, in which the inflammable
air, or some necessary part of it, is undoubtedly absorbed;
and though a little moisture be deposited in the process, it may
well be supposed to be that which in conjunction with phlogiston
constituted the inflammable air. And what can the other
principle that is absorbed by the calx be but the same thing
which, when united to water, is recovered again from the metal
and found to be inflammable air having all the same properties
with that which was employed in the revival of it. Metals
therefore are not simple substances, but consist of their calces,
and something else which they take from inflammable air. And
as the same may also be taken from any combustible substance,
it corresponds exactly to <span class="sc">Stahl&rsquo;s</span> phlogiston, and therefore the
doctrine of it is confirmed by these experiments; that is, we
must still say that in all combustible substances there is a
principle capable of being transferred to other substances, which
when united to the calces of metals makes them to be metals,
and which, united to oil of vitriol (deprived of its water)
makes it to be sulphur.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus was the ingenious man effectually entangled in
his errors, his ingenuity helping him to deceive himself
by evading the force of truth. To err is human. If
Priestley saw through a glass darkly, and but dimly discerned
the truth, he at least strove, so far as in him lay,
to reach the light. Posterity forgives, and may well
forget, his errors in grateful recognition of the many
noble services he rendered to our common humanity,
and in humbling recollection of the suffering and
sacrifice with which those services were requited.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
